# 100 Days & SoC Bootcamp

This is a log of my learning experiences and progress while attempting the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge and attending the School of Code programming bootcamp. Inspired by Kallaway's [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) and Katie Hawcutt's School of Code [bootcamp diary](https://github.com/katiehawcutt/100DaysOfCode).

I started at School of Code about a fortnight after I'd begun the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge, so the start days for both don't align exactly. I'll be updating and classifying my logs weekly for the sake of tidiness, but I'll summarise the first eleven days of the coding challenge here too anyway.

Thanks for stopping by!

# Before the Bootcamp

Small summaries of what I worked on for the first eleven days of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge, prior to starting with the School of Code. Before starting with the School of Code, I would have called myself comfortable-ish with HTML and CSS – a by-product of growing up as an eternally-online teenager – but I've never had any experience with programming proper. Excited to see how this changes going forward!

<br />

**Day 1.** I put together all the HTML for the Technical Documentation Page project with the freeCodeCamp, which is part of the projects you have to complete for their Responsive Web Design certificate. I got the page to pass all of the required tests, so work on making it not quite as hideous with CSS begins tomorrow!

**Day 2.** I added all of the CSS to the Technical Documentation Page for the freeCodeCamp certification and successfully submitted it. Then, I began working on putting together the HTML for the Portfolio Page project for the same certification. Only one left, and then the certificate's done!

**Day 3.** Carried on putting together the HTML for the Portfolio Page project and tidied up the CSS a little bit, sorting out all of the grids and the colour scheme.

**Day 4.** I finished putting together the HTML and the CSS for the Portfolio Page, and it's not perfect, but it passes all the tests and I'm happy with it for now. Which means the Responsive Web Design certificate is finally complete! Going to spend some more time going over the CSS and making things a little neater, before starting the JavaScript module tomorrow.

**Day 5.** Began working through the basic JavaScript module and exercises on freeCodeCamp today! I've only worked with JavaScript a tiny little bit before now, while I was making some event listeners and buttons in my SheCodes Basic final project, so it's all very new. Clicked a wrong back button on the browser and lost all my progress, so had to everything today twice over, but I guess if nothing else it was inbuilt revision time.

**Day 6.** Worked through more of the basic JavaScript module with freeCodeCamp, just hit the bit on arrays!

**Day 7.** Still working through the basic JavaScript module, about halfway through the first one now.

**Day 8.** Still working through the basic JavaScript module, got up to Else If statements.

**Day 9.** Still working through the basic JavaScript module, almost very nearly finished.

**Day 10.** Split today between doing a bit of work on the JavaScript module, and reading a little bit around UI & UX.

**Day 11.** Updated some bits and bobs on GitHub to clean it up, refreshed some CSS projects, and reviewed some git learning materials. Otherwise, taking it easy before the bootcamp begins tomorrow. Excited! Nervous! Still doing it anyway!

# Week One

**Week summary.** This week was my first week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days twelve through eighteen of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Things we worked on this week included: programming and workflow concepts like algorithms, computational thinking, and agile vs. waterfall team set-ups; CSS basics, including selectors, classes and IDs, positioning, creating shapes and images; linking together stylesheets, HTML and JS files; using git and Github to collaborate with others and version control; JavaScript functions, for loops, while loops, if and else if statements and other basics; unweighted squat record (morning ritual).

<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 12).** First day of class! Had some introductions to the curriculum, and basic tenets of agile team flow and computational thinking. I also met my pair programmer for the week, and we spent some time doing some CSS games and exercises to get used to pair programming. It was a fun and a very new experience compared to how I've usually coded before (hunched over a CSS stylesheet in my room, furiously scowling while I'm trying to get a website to stop looking quite so ugly). Another thing that felt new but also really energising was the fact that the bootcamp really is a community, both of current students, alumni, mentors, and lots of other folks. It was great to meet some of the larger team, and to get to know other people in the same boat as myself.

Outside of the things we went over at SoC today, I decided to pause on the freeCodeCamp JavaScript module for a bit, just until we hit that part of the course, so I don't get my wires crossed. Really great first day, though!

**Tuesday (Day 13).** Spent some time getting used to using git, GitHub, and editing CSS and HTML with stylesheets. We learned about computational thinking some more, and how to break down webpages into their design elements so that we could reverse-engineer how they were coded. Me and my programming partner then put together a mini playscript by pushing and pulling an .md back and forth over GitHub, and practiced building a koala together out of CSS.

Using what we’d learned from the day's presentations, we took the thumbnail we were given of how the koala was meant to look, and broke him down into his design elements, making notes on what different bits of the HTML and what CSS properties and functionalities could be used to build him. We put together the shape code we needed first for the building blocks of the koala’s face, and then added the colours in.

Git and GitHub were a bit challenging at first, but the more you practice, the easier they become. My main downfall is accidentally cloning repos down into the last directory I was previously working in. Hoping that becomes muscle memory and I stop doing it so much soon!

**Wednesday (Day 14).** Looking back at my daily tweet for today's entry about my _#100DaysOfCode_ progress, and all it says is 'JavaScript more like JavaRIP'. Luckily, my actual diary has a bit more detail to it. We got started learning JavaScript, and tried building a few functions and a password checker. We got the first half of it to work - if a correct password is entered - but not if an incorrect password is entered. The loop kept cutting out halfway through.

I spent a good bit of the evening trying to figure it out, but I'm trying to be mindful of something Chris Meah said on our first day. We're trying to build habits that will sustain us through a whole career. It is not worth burning out while learning code, and honestly, presenteeist exhaustion is only a net detrimental in all aspects. So! I stopped working on it and did some crocheting instead. I also sent an email reaching out to my in-industry mentor to set up our first meeting today, so will be able to report back on that soon!

**Thursday (Day 15).** Carried on playing with the password checker and made some progress, and set up the meeting officially with my mentor for Friday after class! Me and my programming partner also did some more challenges today working with arrays and objects, and managed to get through all our set tasks for our workshops before time ran out, which we were proud of! We also both felt a lot more comfortable with git and GitHub, using the command line and the terminal, and VSC. Little things, maybe, but having that progress in this short timeframe feels good and solid.

We got the CSS koala from the other day to look right with set px values – we've been working on him on-off through the week – but when we tried to make him reactive today in our out-of-class time, he tragically lost his various eyeballs and ears and noses and such to all four corners of the viewport. Learning doesn't come without trials, but fixing him up will be a weekend job!

**Friday (Day 16).** First hackathon ever! Our goal was to build a rock-paper-scissors game in JavaScript, which was a bit fast-and-loose, but it worked, which is what matters! Excited to carry on perfecting it at the weekend. Had a lot of fun with my programming partner and I think we learned a lot, both technically about JS, as well as more broadly about how to work as a team building a technical project to a deadline. At the end of the day, we presented our progress back to a small group of other teams, and being able to look at other people’s code, talk about our different processes, and see first-hand how creative an endeavour coding can be was really interesting and useful. I also had my introductory meeting with my in-industry mentor! It was really interesting to hear about his journey and experiences, and I'm looking forward to chatting again next week.

This week is going to be a long weekend – Bank Holiday – so we've got a good bit of recap work to do, but I think I'm going to have another crack at the JavaScript freeCodeCamp module if I have some spare time. If nothing else, it'll be good revision over basics.

Overall, the first week at the School of Code was exhausting, but very productive. I really love learning, and it's really exciting to get stuck into something totally new. Looking forward to next week!

**Saturday (Day 17).** Did lots of coding today, putting together working functions from workshops I didn't finish in the week and wrapping them all up. Also polished off a fork of our rock-paper-scissors game in JS, adding in username and score tracking variables! Also very nearly finished building that password authenticator I was struggling with earlier in the week. It's been giving me untold grief and woe, boundless aggravation and tears etc. and such, but once this last loop is fixed, it's all over for that authenticator.

**Sunday (Day 18).** Wrapped up the authenticator! The koala is saved! Also signed up to Codewars, and finished up some last little projects I wanted to revise from in the week.

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** Lots of them this week! Unsurprising, considering it's the first week of this whole experience. I think a few things really stuck with me, though, and I want to make sure I carry them with me as I go on.

Firstly, this week really emphasised to me that things don't have to be perfect on the first try, or even the second or third. Getting something to work is the very first goal to pursue: you can always refactor afterwards.

The process of taking multiple passes at things, and coming back to them again and again – whether to learn, revise, or build – was fruitful and educational too. My mum always tells me that God loves a trier, which Google tells me maybe is not necessarily a complimentary phrase! But she also always tells me that all you can do is your best, and so long as you're doing your best, that will be enough, which feels closer to the sentiment I want to keep in mind this week: so long as you're putting yourself wholly into things, you will get back out what you have committed.

# Week Two

**Week summary.** This week was my second week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days nineteen through twenty-five of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. Things we worked on this week included: the DOM, and interacting with and manipulating the DOM; event listeners and more functions and loops in JavaScript; fetching data from APIs, navigating their data, and using them to build more interactive and responsive web content; introduction to the call stack; asynchronous coding, CSS flexboxes and display elements.

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 19).** Bank Holiday, so no SoC today! Carried on going over workshops from earlier, though, worked on some for loops and arrays for a bit to cement my learning, and I did a few levels on Codewars. Took it easier, though, today: did some gardening! Turnips are looking grand! Radishes are looking dire! Such is life!

**Tuesday (Day 20).** New weekly pair programmer today! In the morning, we had a great talk today from some SoC alumni who now work at Wise, including the same Katie Hawcutt whose GitHub learning diary inspired this one! Getting their insight and reflections was really useful, and it was interesting to see how broadly they'd diversified after gradutating, even within the same company.

Otherwise, class was focused on learning about the DOM, and working with event listeners and loops some more to incorporate the DOM into our current experience with JavaScript. Did a lot of post-bootcamp work on the day's workshops to try and get to grips with it all, which did not happen first time around, but it is what it is. The first day learning something new is never the day you are totally comfortable with it.

Connected with some other bootcampers outside of classes too, to chat about how things are going and other bits and bobs. One thing I really do like about SoC is how diverse the bootcamp is, and how the community is made of people from all walks of life, pursuing a common goal together.

**Wednesday (Day 21).** Found out what an API is today, and used one for the very first time! Me and my programming partner built a quote generator using the Kanye API, and got some more practice with JavaScript functions to interact with APIs and to store data. We also had an introduction to the call stack, and using the DOM to manipulate HTML and CSS.

After yesterday – which, in all honesty, was a challenging day – it felt like a real win when me and my programming partner got up to speed with the day's workshops and stretch tasks pretty quickly. Pride comes before the fall, of course, but I'm really proud of the team today nonetheless!

**Thursday (Day 22).** My instinct was right, hilariously and tragically – another tough one! We had a workshop where we had to try and do a virtual space-themed escape room, using fetch requests with APIs to call for and send back information about some rocket ship launch codes.

What held us up wasn't a technical challenge at all, in the end, but we were trying to over-solve a problem that did not need solving. We tried for a good while to display the information from our API in various onscreen formats, none of which was necessary – we just needed to fetch the data (which we actually had done in a comically short amount of time at the beginning of the workshop, incidentally) and read it manually in the console. On the plus side, learning not to over-solve problems is a lesson best learned earlier rather than later, at least! (And it was a little funny when one of the coaches pointed our needless extra work out.)

Tomorrow is the hackathon, and I'm a bit nervous for it this week, but you just have to take every day as it comes. I finished some bits of code that had seemed really troublesome at the beginning of the week today in my spare time, so if nothing else, I know things are sinking in.

I also started an extra project that I’m going to try and work on in my spare time. It’s a refactored version of last week's rock-paper-scissors, except it’s going to be run through events and the DOM instead of just through the console and alerts and prompts that we were building with previously. Funny to think back on how much you can learn even in the shortest timeframe.

**Friday (Day 23).** Hackathon Friday!

The challenge today was, very broadly, to build a project with some APIs using fetch requests, using a couple of different APIs suggested by SoC.

A very non-specific target, so! We started with Plan 1.0. We decided that the core of whatever we built should use at least one example of every new thing we'd learnt or worked on the past week: event listeners, loops that interact with the DOM and visuals of the webpage, using asynchronous code to fetch and navigate data, and potentially the setTimeout and setInterval functions.

After we knew we wanted to use these specific elements, we moved onto Plan 1.1. Thinking about MVPs and agile working, we decided to start off by building a basic webpage that took input from one button to begin with, and generated a profile of a pokemon from the PokeAPI. After we got all of that together and working, we then moved on to implementing more features and slightly more complex code, writing up new mini-plans and stretch goals as we went, and keeping a note at the bottom of our code of refactoring ideas and helpful things we learned in the process of building.

Our ultimate project ended up being a 'guess that pokemon' game. The computer would generate a random pokemon profile by pulling from the PokeAPI. We disguised some of the data we'd stored in onscreen variables from the user's view, so they would have to try and guess what pokemon profile had been generated based on limited information. If they guessed right, the full profile and a congratulation message would be revealed, and if not, they would receive the failure message instead. My teammate wanted to work on their CSS knowledge, so they added some cool styling features to the first iteration of the final product, and I learned a lot in fixing one of our JavaScript issues while they were hard at work. We did a short presentation back to a smaller group of thirty people about our progress and work at the end of the day, and it was really nice to show what we'd accomplished, what we'd hope to accomplish with more time, where some of our challenges had been, and then to compare that with the other teams and their experiences.

We didn't reach all our stretch goals on the day, but we made a lot of progress from where we first started. I'm really proud of what we built, and I think a real strength of our team – and a working habit I'm going to take away from this week – is the process of methodical but adaptable planning and progress review.

I also had another chat with my mentor after class, and got some really good advice on a few questions I'd been mulling over in the week, and some interesting resource pointers. It was a pretty long day, but I wanted to get through some work and was feeling pretty energised after the hackathon, so I also got through the weekend’s recap tasks in the evening.

**Saturday (Day 24).** Finished off the bonus tasks for the weekend recap tasks! Built a to-do list maker and organiser with JavaScript! Got some gardening done and planted some baby spinach and kale and parsley! Watched a few videos on flexbox! Spent most of the evening typing up this whole document up until today's date! README.ception!

**Sunday (Day 25).** Woke up early and spent the first part of the morning converting last week's rock-paper-scissors game from being console-based only to being interactive with the DOM and displaying on the webpage. Haven't done any styling yet, but I've got some ideas noted down that I'm going to try out later or next week.

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** Don't over-engineer! And it's great practice to plan well in the beginning, starting small and clean and functional, before returning to your original plans at later intervals in order to re-evaluate and stretch for newer, loftier goals. Sometimes, the best thing to do to when you're struggling with a coding problem is to put it down for a bit to let your brain turn over it in a new way later.

# Week Three

**Week summary.** This week was my third week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days twenty-six through thirty-two of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. Things we worked on this week included: UX/UI fundamentals; the design thought process; agile methodology and the agile manifesto, and integrating UX and agile working methods; user-centred design; user research with things like personas, stories, journey maps and other research exercises; Disney ideation; prototyping and low and high fidelity wireframing; accessibility in design and experience; deep and active listening, and overcoming listening challenges in teams; more advanced CSS.

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 26).** It’s UX/UI week!

This morning was mostly a talk by Paaven Buddhdev, about ‘Do U(X) Believe in Magic?’ It was really cool and insightful to hear about his journey into his role, and the experience of working as a UX/UI designer and consultant. I also met my programming partner for the week, and we went through some presentations with Liz about agile working, the history of agile working, and different ways of working with agile thinking at their heart. To close the day, we did our feedback for last week, and we also played a game called cantunsee.space, which was meant to show us about the small details that can impact a piece of UI design, and how they all come together to make or break a whole.

We didn't get any JavaScript or too much CSS done during hours today, so I did a few hours' work after class finished, and worked on fine-tuning the rock-paper-scissors game that I started editing last week.

**Tuesday (Day 27).** Had a really great talk today from Adam Fairholm and Javaid Karim at Nester about how their UX/UI process has been for developing their investment app, and how to balance the needs of the user and customer against the needs of the business (considering the FCA, legal requirements, etc.)

I also attended a great talk at Config about ‘Designing for Neurodiversity’ by Treyce Meredith, and how we can centre success and abundance in our design, and not just the compliance of access.

Otherwise, we did some workshops on Disney ideation and user testing in order to refine user personas, user stories, and build and design a product in an agile way. Then, we did a CSS workshop where we learned how to use CSS variables and how to set toggle variables, for things like dark modes etc.

Really enjoying UX/UI week! I want to make sure all the recent coding experience sticks in my mind though while we're focusing more on design thinking. So, this morning, I got up early and cleaned up some of the CSS and the JavaScript for the rock-paper-scissors game.

**Wednesday (Day 28).** Today, we had a talk from Luke with Immediate Media - the people who did the website coding for the Radio Times and BBC Good Foods - and heard about his journey, as well as how he hires and works as the company’s lead UI developer! We also learned about user interfaces, wire-framing, and got to use some user interfacing tools to create a mock-up of our projects we were working on yesterday. We learned a bit more about keeping your CSS files tidy, and we did a little bit of reading in the docs.

Outside of class, I also got my dark mode toggle on my rock-paper-scissors game to work, and so once I’ve coded some aesthetics onto the actual button itself, I’m going to leave that one alone for a bit and start building a new project!

**Thursday (Day 29).** A long day! Had our usual mindset session with Joe, which, this week, was about learning how to listen deeply and actively in order to overcome moments of friction in a team.

Then, we had a talk from an ex-bootcamper, Olivia Winteringham, who is now a UX/UI designer at Santander! Apparently, she doesn’t do that much coding at all in her job, but it’s very social, and there’s a lot of interaction with customers, users, stakeholders, other teams, things like that. It was really interesting to hear about her journey, and how the experience of working in UX/UI can still be creative, but maybe not in the way that you’d first think. More about creative problem-solving, than necessarily having to be great at illustration.

Then, we learned a bit about ordering CSS and using flexbox some more with Helena. The coaches alluded to media queries, but didn’t go into them. I’m already a bit familiar, but more experience would be nice, so maybe I’ll look into it at the weekend for a refresher.

And, finally, in the afternoon me and my pair programmer this week got together with another team to build a user journey map for an imaginary app - a competitor to Expedia and Kayak - and then presented what we’d worked on and learned back to one of the coding coaches and a group of about thirty other people.

Went well, and I think our team came off really polished! Glad I could help us present in a clean, collated way. I’d like to get quicker at talking, but I think since I finished my MSc, my presentation, planning and teamwork skills have definitely levelled up, and presenting in front of people doesn't generally feel daunting anymore. I'm sure that will change when we do the big presentations at the end of the course! But I'm hoping that getting all this practice in now, and sticking to my process – making sure I've got a short, solid plan, and I know my key points – puts me in good stead.

But yeah! Hackathon tomorrow! It’s going to be based around making a fake landing page for a website that me and and my partner ideated today. Looking forward to it!

**Friday (Day 30).** Hackathon Friday once again!

A very UX/UI centred day today. It was our job to take some ideas we had for a landing page, and then put them through the design thinking wringer. The emphasis was less on getting to complete the code, and more about user research, and using that research to centre our approach to the project at hand. It was very interesting, and I loved the combination of methodical approach with creative problem-solving!

Ultimately, our team didn’t get into the CSS and HTML, but it wasn't the focus of the task, and besides, we got very close! We got to planning out our high fidelity wireframes and looking at palettes and mood associations with typography, and I think we really did well.

After class, I had my usual Friday chat with my mentor. Another really interesting talk that I really enjoyed. We talked about the ecological impact of coding and software development, and how companies do - or do not - do their part to try and mitigate it, as well as levels of personal responsibility for coding in a green way. We also talked about his preference for back-end work, and about the mechanics of how game code is written, and how the IDE differs in game programming, compared to regular IDEs.

This weekend’s recap task is to begin planning a portfolio, so that’s what I’m going to do today! And tomorrow too probably, but I want to at least get through a bit of work this evening.

Really loved the week. Apprehensive but excited to try server-side programming next week. Took a long time to install nvm, but hopefully that was the first and last nightmare on this auspicious (or not) day!

**Saturday (Day 31).** Spent all day on my planning and wireframes for the portfolio website! I think I probably could've put less effort into it, for the sake of passing the task, but I really want to finish this project and have it be version 1.0 of my portfolio for the end of the course. So, I put the hours in! Tragically, I missed seeing out historic performance in the Eurovision live, and I kind of do regret doing so much work today. There's a big family thing on Sunday, though, so I guess it's like Liz always says: trade-offs for everything. You can't fit it all in! But you can do your best!

**Sunday (Day 32).** Finished the high-fidelity wireframes for the first draft of my portfolio. I'm going to put them in a repo on my GitHub by themselves once I've coded a first-draft of the CSS, HTML and JS, but [here's a sneak peek](https://www.figma.com/proto/VjKqj0v019CX4fdlSRjErL/W3-Hifi-Wireframe?node-id=9%3A63&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=9%3A63). I'm going to do a little bit more work on another JavaScript project – the cat treat randomiser my sister asked me to make – and then I'm going to relax for the evening. Back-end work starts tomorrow, got to make sure I'm rested!

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** I wrote down so many quotes from our guest speakers this week, and from the Config conference, but a few are really sticking with me, so I want to note them here to centre them in my thoughts and process. First, I loved how Paavan connected UX and magic, and how he emphasised that UX is about storytelling, attention, and wonder. Treyce Meredith did a really good talk about designing for neurodiversity at the Figma conference too, and he emphasised how features should be abundant, how we should make sure we are forgiving in the interface, make sure the tools we make are nurturing in order to encourage creativity, and how we should go beyond accessibility compliance to think about accessibility success. It was really great to be able to contribute to several teams this week, and I'm looking forward to more fruitful, collaborative work in the future.
