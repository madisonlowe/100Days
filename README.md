# 100 Days & SoC Bootcamp

This is a log of my learning experiences and progress while attempting the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge and attending the School of Code programming bootcamp. Inspired by Kallaway's [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) and Katie Hawcutt's School of Code [bootcamp diary](https://github.com/katiehawcutt/100DaysOfCode).

I started at School of Code about a fortnight after I'd begun the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge, so the start days for both don't align exactly. I'll be updating and classifying my logs weekly for the sake of tidiness, but I'll summarise the first eleven days of the coding challenge here too anyway.

Thanks for stopping by!

# Before the Bootcamp

Small summaries of what I worked on for the first eleven days of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge, prior to starting with the School of Code. Before starting with the School of Code, I would have called myself comfortable-ish with HTML and CSS – a by-product of growing up as an eternally-online teenager – but I've never had any experience with programming proper. Excited to see how this changes going forward!

<summary>Day 1 – Day 11 (#100DaysOfCode)</summary>
<br />

**Day 1.** I put together all the HTML for the Technical Documentation Page project with the freeCodeCamp, which is part of the projects you have to complete for their Responsive Web Design certificate. I got the page to pass all of the required tests, so work on making it not quite as hideous with CSS begins tomorrow!

**Day 2.** I added all of the CSS to the Technical Documentation Page for the freeCodeCamp certification and successfully submitted it. Then, I began working on putting together the HTML for the Portfolio Page project for the same certification. Only one left, and then the certificate's done!

**Day 3.** Carried on putting together the HTML for the Portfolio Page project and tidied up the CSS a little bit, sorting out all of the grids and the colour scheme.

**Day 4.** I finished putting together the HTML and the CSS for the Portfolio Page, and it's not perfect, but it passes all the tests and I'm happy with it for now. Which means the Responsive Web Design certificate is finally complete! Going to spend some more time going over the CSS and making things a little neater, before starting the JavaScript module tomorrow.

**Day 5.** Began working through the basic JavaScript module and exercises on freeCodeCamp today! I've only worked with JavaScript a tiny little bit before now, while I was making some event listeners and buttons in my SheCodes Basic final project, so it's all very new. Clicked a wrong back button on the browser and lost all my progress, so had to everything today twice over, but I guess if nothing else it was inbuilt revision time.

**Day 6.** Worked through more of the basic JavaScript module with freeCodeCamp, just hit the bit on arrays!

**Day 7.** Still working through the basic JavaScript module, about halfway through the first one now.

**Day 8.** Still working through the basic JavaScript module, got up to Else If statements.

**Day 9.** Still working through the basic JavaScript module, almost very nearly finished.

**Day 10.** Split today between doing a bit of work on the JavaScript module, and reading a little bit around UI & UX.

**Day 11.** Updated some bits and bobs on GitHub to clean it up, refreshed some CSS projects, and reviewed some git learning materials. Otherwise, taking it easy before the bootcamp begins tomorrow. Excited! Nervous! Still doing it anyway!

# Week One

**Week summary.** This week was my first week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days twelve through eighteen of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Things we worked on this week included: programming and workflow concepts like algorithms, computational thinking, and agile vs. waterfall team set-ups; CSS basics, including selectors, classes and IDs, positioning, creating shapes and images; linking together stylesheets, HTML and JS files; using git and Github to collaborate with others and version control; JavaScript functions, for loops, while loops, if and else if statements and other basics; unweighted squat record (morning ritual).

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 12).** First day of class! Had some introductions to the curriculum, and basic tenets of agile team flow and computational thinking. I also met my pair programmer for the week, and we spent some time doing some CSS games and exercises to get used to pair programming. It was a fun and a very new experience compared to how I've usually coded before (hunched over a CSS stylesheet in my room, furiously scowling while I'm trying to get a website to stop looking quite so ugly). Another thing that felt new but also really energising was the fact that the bootcamp really is a community, both of current students, alumni, mentors, and lots of other folks. It was great to meet some of the larger team, and to get to know other people in the same boat as myself.

Outside of the things we went over at SoC today, I decided to pause on the freeCodeCamp JavaScript module for a bit, just until we hit that part of the course, so I don't get my wires crossed. Really great first day, though!

**Tuesday (Day 13).** Spent some time getting used to using git, GitHub, and editing CSS and HTML with stylesheets. We learned about computational thinking some more, and how to break down webpages into their design elements so that we could reverse-engineer how they were coded. Me and my programming partner then put together a mini playscript by pushing and pulling an .md back and forth over GitHub, and practiced building a koala together out of CSS.

Using what we’d learned from the day's presentations, we took the thumbnail we were given of how the koala was meant to look, and broke him down into his design elements, making notes on what different bits of the HTML and what CSS properties and functionalities could be used to build him. We put together the shape code we needed first for the building blocks of the koala’s face, and then added the colours in.

Git and GitHub were a bit challenging at first, but the more you practice, the easier they become. My main downfall is accidentally cloning repos down into the last directory I was previously working in. Hoping that becomes muscle memory and I stop doing it so much soon!

**Wednesday (Day 14).** Looking back at my daily tweet for today's entry about my _#100DaysOfCode_ progress, and all it says is 'JavaScript more like JavaRIP'. Luckily, my actual diary has a bit more detail to it. We got started learning JavaScript, and tried building a few functions and a password checker. We got the first half of it to work - if a correct password is entered - but not if an incorrect password is entered. The loop kept cutting out halfway through.

I spent a good bit of the evening trying to figure it out, but I'm trying to be mindful of something Chris Meah said on our first day. We're trying to build habits that will sustain us through a whole career. It is not worth burning out while learning code, and honestly, presenteeist exhaustion is only a net detrimental in all aspects. So! I stopped working on it and did some crocheting instead. I also sent an email reaching out to my in-industry mentor to set up our first meeting today, so will be able to report back on that soon!

**Thursday (Day 15).** Carried on playing with the password checker and made some progress, and set up the meeting officially with my mentor for Friday after class! Me and my programming partner also did some more challenges today working with arrays and objects, and managed to get through all our set tasks for our workshops before time ran out, which we were proud of! We also both felt a lot more comfortable with git and GitHub, using the command line and the terminal, and VSC. Little things, maybe, but having that progress in this short timeframe feels good and solid.

We got the CSS koala from the other day to look right with set px values – we've been working on him on-off through the week – but when we tried to make him reactive today in our out-of-class time, he tragically lost his various eyeballs and ears and noses and such to all four corners of the viewport. Learning doesn't come without trials, but fixing him up will be a weekend job!

**Friday (Day 16).** First hackathon ever! Our goal was to build a rock-paper-scissors game in JavaScript, which was a bit fast-and-loose, but it worked, which is what matters! Excited to carry on perfecting it at the weekend. Had a lot of fun with my programming partner and I think we learned a lot, both technically about JS, as well as more broadly about how to work as a team building a technical project to a deadline. At the end of the day, we presented our progress back to a small group of other teams, and being able to look at other people’s code, talk about our different processes, and see first-hand how creative an endeavour coding can be was really interesting and useful. I also had my introductory meeting with my in-industry mentor! It was really interesting to hear about his journey and experiences, and I'm looking forward to chatting again next week.

This week is going to be a long weekend – Bank Holiday – so we've got a good bit of recap work to do, but I think I'm going to have another crack at the JavaScript freeCodeCamp module if I have some spare time. If nothing else, it'll be good revision over basics.

Overall, the first week at the School of Code was exhausting, but very productive. I really love learning, and it's really exciting to get stuck into something totally new. Looking forward to next week!

**Saturday (Day 17).** Did lots of coding today, putting together working functions from workshops I didn't finish in the week and wrapping them all up. Also polished off a fork of our rock-paper-scissors game in JS, adding in username and score tracking variables! Also very nearly finished building that password authenticator I was struggling with earlier in the week. It's been giving me untold grief and woe, boundless aggravation and tears etc. and such, but once this last loop is fixed, it's all over for that authenticator.

**Sunday (Day 18).** Wrapped up the authenticator! The koala is saved! Also signed up to Codewars, and finished up some last little projects I wanted to revise from in the week.

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** Lots of them this week! Unsurprising, considering it's the first week of this whole experience. I think a few things really stuck with me, though, and I want to make sure I carry them with me as I go on.

Firstly, this week really emphasised to me that things don't have to be perfect on the first try, or even the second or third. Getting something to work is the very first goal to pursue: you can always refactor afterwards.

The process of taking multiple passes at things, and coming back to them again and again – whether to learn, revise, or build – was fruitful and educational too. My mum always tells me that God loves a trier, which Google tells me maybe is not necessarily a complimentary phrase! But she also always tells me that all you can do is your best, and so long as you're doing your best, that will be enough, which feels closer to the sentiment I want to keep in mind this week: so long as you're putting yourself wholly into things, you will get back out what you have committed.

# Week Two

**Week summary.** This week was my second week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days nineteen through twenty-five of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. Things we worked on this week included: the DOM, and interacting with and manipulating the DOM; event listeners and more functions and loops in JavaScript; fetching data from APIs, navigating their data, and using them to build more interactive and responsive web content; introduction to the call stack; asynchronous coding, CSS flexboxes and display elements.

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 19).** Bank Holiday, so no SoC today! Carried on going over workshops from earlier, though, worked on some for loops and arrays for a bit to cement my learning, and I did a few levels on Codewars. Took it easier, though, today: did some gardening! Turnips are looking grand! Radishes are looking dire! Such is life!

**Tuesday (Day 20).** New weekly pair programmer today! In the morning, we had a great talk today from some SoC alumni who now work at Wise, including the same Katie Hawcutt whose GitHub learning diary inspired this one! Getting their insight and reflections was really useful, and it was interesting to see how broadly they'd diversified after gradutating, even within the same company.

Otherwise, class was focused on learning about the DOM, and working with event listeners and loops some more to incorporate the DOM into our current experience with JavaScript. Did a lot of post-bootcamp work on the day's workshops to try and get to grips with it all, which did not happen first time around, but it is what it is. The first day learning something new is never the day you are totally comfortable with it.

Connected with some other bootcampers outside of classes too, to chat about how things are going and other bits and bobs. One thing I really do like about SoC is how diverse the bootcamp is, and how the community is made of people from all walks of life, pursuing a common goal together.

**Wednesday (Day 21).** Found out what an API is today, and used one for the very first time! Me and my programming partner built a quote generator using the Kanye API, and got some more practice with JavaScript functions to interact with APIs and to store data. We also had an introduction to the call stack, and using the DOM to manipulate HTML and CSS.

After yesterday – which, in all honesty, was a challenging day – it felt like a real win when me and my programming partner got up to speed with the day's workshops and stretch tasks pretty quickly. Pride comes before the fall, of course, but I'm really proud of the team today nonetheless!

**Thursday (Day 22).** My instinct was right, hilariously and tragically – another tough one! We had a workshop where we had to try and do a virtual space-themed escape room, using fetch requests with APIs to call for and send back information about some rocket ship launch codes.

What held us up wasn't a technical challenge at all, in the end, but we were trying to over-solve a problem that did not need solving. We tried for a good while to display the information from our API in various onscreen formats, none of which was necessary – we just needed to fetch the data (which we actually had done in a comically short amount of time at the beginning of the workshop, incidentally) and read it manually in the console. On the plus side, learning not to over-solve problems is a lesson best learned earlier rather than later, at least! (And it was a little funny when one of the coaches pointed our needless extra work out.)

Tomorrow is the hackathon, and I'm a bit nervous for it this week, but you just have to take every day as it comes. I finished some bits of code that had seemed really troublesome at the beginning of the week today in my spare time, so if nothing else, I know things are sinking in.

I also started an extra project that I’m going to try and work on in my spare time. It’s a refactored version of last week's rock-paper-scissors, except it’s going to be run through events and the DOM instead of just through the console and alerts and prompts that we were building with previously. Funny to think back on how much you can learn even in the shortest timeframe.

**Friday (Day 23).** Hackathon Friday!

The challenge today was, very broadly, to build a project with some APIs using fetch requests, using a couple of different APIs suggested by SoC.

A very non-specific target, so! We started with Plan 1.0. We decided that the core of whatever we built should use at least one example of every new thing we'd learnt or worked on the past week: event listeners, loops that interact with the DOM and visuals of the webpage, using asynchronous code to fetch and navigate data, and potentially the setTimeout and setInterval functions.

After we knew we wanted to use these specific elements, we moved onto Plan 1.1. Thinking about MVPs and agile working, we decided to start off by building a basic webpage that took input from one button to begin with, and generated a profile of a pokemon from the PokeAPI. After we got all of that together and working, we then moved on to implementing more features and slightly more complex code, writing up new mini-plans and stretch goals as we went, and keeping a note at the bottom of our code of refactoring ideas and helpful things we learned in the process of building.

Our ultimate project ended up being a 'guess that pokemon' game. The computer would generate a random pokemon profile by pulling from the PokeAPI. We disguised some of the data we'd stored in onscreen variables from the user's view, so they would have to try and guess what pokemon profile had been generated based on limited information. If they guessed right, the full profile and a congratulation message would be revealed, and if not, they would receive the failure message instead. My teammate wanted to work on their CSS knowledge, so they added some cool styling features to the first iteration of the final product, and I learned a lot in fixing one of our JavaScript issues while they were hard at work. We did a short presentation back to a smaller group of thirty people about our progress and work at the end of the day, and it was really nice to show what we'd accomplished, what we'd hope to accomplish with more time, where some of our challenges had been, and then to compare that with the other teams and their experiences.

We didn't reach all our stretch goals on the day, but we made a lot of progress from where we first started. I'm really proud of what we built, and I think a real strength of our team – and a working habit I'm going to take away from this week – is the process of methodical but adaptable planning and progress review.

I also had another chat with my mentor after class, and got some really good advice on a few questions I'd been mulling over in the week, and some interesting resource pointers. It was a pretty long day, but I wanted to get through some work and was feeling pretty energised after the hackathon, so I also got through the weekend’s recap tasks in the evening.

**Saturday (Day 24).** Finished off the bonus tasks for the weekend recap tasks! Built a to-do list maker and organiser with JavaScript! Got some gardening done and planted some baby spinach and kale and parsley! Watched a few videos on flexbox! Spent most of the evening typing up this whole document up until today's date! README.ception!

**Sunday (Day 25).** Woke up early and spent the first part of the morning converting last week's rock-paper-scissors game from being console-based only to being interactive with the DOM and displaying on the webpage. Haven't done any styling yet, but I've got some ideas noted down that I'm going to try out later or next week.

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** Don't over-engineer! And it's great practice to plan well in the beginning, starting small and clean and functional, before returning to your original plans at later intervals in order to re-evaluate and stretch for newer, loftier goals. Sometimes, the best thing to do to when you're struggling with a coding problem is to put it down for a bit to let your brain turn over it in a new way later.

# Week Three

**Week summary.** This week was my third week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days twenty-six through thirty-two of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. Things we worked on this week included: UX/UI fundamentals; the design thought process; agile methodology and the agile manifesto, and integrating UX and agile working methods; user-centred design; user research with things like personas, stories, journey maps and other research exercises; Disney ideation; prototyping and low and high fidelity wireframing; accessibility in design and experience; deep and active listening, and overcoming listening challenges in teams; more advanced CSS.

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 26).** It’s UX/UI week!

This morning was mostly a talk by Paaven Buddhdev, about ‘Do U(X) Believe in Magic?’ It was really cool and insightful to hear about his journey into his role, and the experience of working as a UX/UI designer and consultant. I also met my programming partner for the week, and we went through some presentations with Liz about agile working, the history of agile working, and different ways of working with agile thinking at their heart. To close the day, we did our feedback for last week, and we also played a game called cantunsee.space, which was meant to show us about the small details that can impact a piece of UI design, and how they all come together to make or break a whole.

We didn't get any JavaScript or too much CSS done during hours today, so I did a few hours' work after class finished, and worked on fine-tuning the rock-paper-scissors game that I started editing last week.

**Tuesday (Day 27).** Had a really great talk today from Adam Fairholm and Javaid Karim at Nester about how their UX/UI process has been for developing their investment app, and how to balance the needs of the user and customer against the needs of the business (considering the FCA, legal requirements, etc.)

I also attended a great talk at Config about ‘Designing for Neurodiversity’ by Treyce Meredith, and how we can centre success and abundance in our design, and not just the compliance of access.

Otherwise, we did some workshops on Disney ideation and user testing in order to refine user personas, user stories, and build and design a product in an agile way. Then, we did a CSS workshop where we learned how to use CSS variables and how to set toggle variables, for things like dark modes etc.

Really enjoying UX/UI week! I want to make sure all the recent coding experience sticks in my mind though while we're focusing more on design thinking. So, this morning, I got up early and cleaned up some of the CSS and the JavaScript for the rock-paper-scissors game.

**Wednesday (Day 28).** Today, we had a talk from Luke with Immediate Media - the people who did the website coding for the Radio Times and BBC Good Foods - and heard about his journey, as well as how he hires and works as the company’s lead UI developer! We also learned about user interfaces, wire-framing, and got to use some user interfacing tools to create a mock-up of our projects we were working on yesterday. We learned a bit more about keeping your CSS files tidy, and we did a little bit of reading in the docs.

Outside of class, I also got my dark mode toggle on my rock-paper-scissors game to work, and so once I’ve coded some aesthetics onto the actual button itself, I’m going to leave that one alone for a bit and start building a new project!

**Thursday (Day 29).** A long day! Had our usual mindset session with Joe, which, this week, was about learning how to listen deeply and actively in order to overcome moments of friction in a team.

Then, we had a talk from an ex-bootcamper, Olivia Winteringham, who is now a UX/UI designer at Santander! Apparently, she doesn’t do that much coding at all in her job, but it’s very social, and there’s a lot of interaction with customers, users, stakeholders, other teams, things like that. It was really interesting to hear about her journey, and how the experience of working in UX/UI can still be creative, but maybe not in the way that you’d first think. More about creative problem-solving, than necessarily having to be great at illustration.

Then, we learned a bit about ordering CSS and using flexbox some more with Helena. The coaches alluded to media queries, but didn’t go into them. I’m already a bit familiar, but more experience would be nice, so maybe I’ll look into it at the weekend for a refresher.

And, finally, in the afternoon me and my pair programmer this week got together with another team to build a user journey map for an imaginary app - a competitor to Expedia and Kayak - and then presented what we’d worked on and learned back to one of the coding coaches and a group of about thirty other people.

Went well, and I think our team came off really polished! Glad I could help us present in a clean, collated way. I’d like to get quicker at talking, but I think since I finished my MSc, my presentation, planning and teamwork skills have definitely levelled up, and presenting in front of people doesn't generally feel daunting anymore. I'm sure that will change when we do the big presentations at the end of the course! But I'm hoping that getting all this practice in now, and sticking to my process – making sure I've got a short, solid plan, and I know my key points – puts me in good stead.

But yeah! Hackathon tomorrow! It’s going to be based around making a fake landing page for a website that me and and my partner ideated today. Looking forward to it!

**Friday (Day 30).** Hackathon Friday once again!

A very UX/UI centred day today. It was our job to take some ideas we had for a landing page, and then put them through the design thinking wringer. The emphasis was less on getting to complete the code, and more about user research, and using that research to centre our approach to the project at hand. It was very interesting, and I loved the combination of methodical approach with creative problem-solving!

Ultimately, our team didn’t get into the CSS and HTML, but it wasn't the focus of the task, and besides, we got very close! We got to planning out our high fidelity wireframes and looking at palettes and mood associations with typography, and I think we really did well.

After class, I had my usual Friday chat with my mentor. Another really interesting talk that I really enjoyed. We talked about the ecological impact of coding and software development, and how companies do - or do not - do their part to try and mitigate it, as well as levels of personal responsibility for coding in a green way. We also talked about his preference for back-end work, and about the mechanics of how game code is written, and how the IDE differs in game programming, compared to regular IDEs.

This weekend’s recap task is to begin planning a portfolio, so that’s what I’m going to do today! And tomorrow too probably, but I want to at least get through a bit of work this evening.

Really loved the week. Apprehensive but excited to try server-side programming next week. Took a long time to install nvm, but hopefully that was the first and last nightmare on this auspicious (or not) day!

**Saturday (Day 31).** Spent all day on my planning and wireframes for the portfolio website! I think I probably could've put less effort into it, for the sake of passing the task, but I really want to finish this project and have it be version 1.0 of my portfolio for the end of the course. So, I put the hours in! Tragically, I missed seeing out historic performance in the Eurovision live, and I kind of do regret doing so much work today. There's a big family thing on Sunday, though, so I guess it's like Liz always says: trade-offs for everything. You can't fit it all in! But you can do your best!

**Sunday (Day 32).** Finished the high-fidelity wireframes for the first draft of my portfolio. I'm going to put them in a repo on my GitHub by themselves once I've coded a first-draft of the CSS, HTML and JS, but [here's a sneak peek](https://www.figma.com/proto/VjKqj0v019CX4fdlSRjErL/W3-Hifi-Wireframe?node-id=9%3A63&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=9%3A63). I'm going to do a little bit more work on another JavaScript project – the cat treat randomiser my sister asked me to make – and then I'm going to relax for the evening. Back-end work starts tomorrow, got to make sure I'm rested!

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** I wrote down so many quotes from our guest speakers this week, and from the Config conference, but a few are really sticking with me, so I want to note them here to centre them in my thoughts and process. First, I loved how Paavan connected UX and magic, and how he emphasised that UX is about storytelling, attention, and wonder. Treyce Meredith did a really good talk about designing for neurodiversity at the Figma conference too, and he emphasised how features should be abundant, how we should make sure we are forgiving in the interface, make sure the tools we make are nurturing in order to encourage creativity, and how we should go beyond accessibility compliance to think about accessibility success. It was really great to be able to contribute to several teams this week, and I'm looking forward to more fruitful, collaborative work in the future.

<br />

# Week Four

**Week summary.** This week was my fourth week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days thirty-three through thirty-nine of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. Things we worked on this week included: learning about node, npm, nvm and how they interact; vertical and horizontal scaling in servers; how servers work asynchronously; CommonJS and ES6 import and export syntax and methods; how to modularise server code and separate concerns; building functional routers and models; building CRUD functions; building APIs RESTfully; using Postman to test servers; built a couple of API servers!

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 33).** First ever day working with back-end tech!

Met my new weekly programming partner, and we got to know each other and gave each other mini presentations of what we’d been working on over the weekend. We had a recap task to do some research and create some wireframes and maybe a little bit of code for a personal portfolio and website. It was really cool to see how different concerns about the way we wanted to present ourselves, and who we were presenting to, changed how we approached the task in drastic ways. I think it’s also just fun to see how people see themselves, whether through their colour schemes or the other design choices they make.

Then, we spent a lot of the day going through demos and introductory talks and question-answer sessions about node, nvm, npm and nodist etc. We also learned a little bit more about the specifics of how servers work. Then, in the latter half of the day, we got to get some practice in by doing a workshop based on the chalk npm.

It was really fun! We got through the whole workshop pretty quickly, so we did some experimentation with other packages and we went through the full docs instead of just what we needed for the workshop. I’m sure it’s going to get much harder from now on, so I don’t want to jinx myself! But for a first introduction to back-end programming, I enjoyed today.

**Tuesday (Day 34).** We learned some more about node.js today, and then about how to use express to spin up servers, as well as about using nodemon to make it so that we don’t have to constantly kill and reboot the server every time we make file changes. We also worked through some workshops, where we created some .js files of information, imported and exported it into different .js files, and then spun up a server and made calls to it in order to access the information files we’d created. We learned about when to use commonjs and when to use ES6 in order to make these import and export requests too. We’re practicing this so that we can build up to creating our own API on Friday for the hackathon, I think!

I was really intimidated by the back-end before we started this week, but so far, it’s going pretty smoothly. I don’t think we’re doing anything too complex yet, comparatively, so maybe I won’t feel the same tomorrow! But I’m trying to be open to failure and experimentation with new things, and it’s really fun learning about the different elements of back-end programming. They can be really powerful, and I’m excited to learn more about them.

I got called on at the end of the day for the end-of-day reflections, and I said that the thing I took away from today was the value of not panicking. Which I can sometimes be hypocritical about - we all panic, me often, and about the tiniest things! But it’s okay to be bad at something, or not to get it the first couple of times. It’s about being open to learning, change, and being wrong. And when you’re panicking, you’ll never learn anything, you’ll just close up out of fear. Anyway, had a good day, did a bit of extra experimentation after class on using the servers, and pumped for tomorrow.

**Wednesday (Day 35).** We covered a lot of ground today! We learned about how to modularise our server code and use route handlers for server traffic, and how to send and receive information along these paths. We also learned how to respond to queries and non-get requests, learned a little bit about RESTful APIs and data organisation, and a little bit about other kinds of data requests, We’ll be workshopping those more tomorrow!

The theory is making sense to me, it’s just a lot of moving parts to piece together and remember all at once. A bit fiddly and lots of syntax! But enjoying it a lot, actually. I’m really excited for this week’s hackathon, and to use what we’ve learned in a side project when it comes to it.

**Thursday (Day 36).** Today, in order, we covered: Thursday mindset session with Joe about confronting your inner critic and turning them into your inner champion; workshop learning about what middleware is, the functions it provides in a server, and how to add one to our code; workshop on POST requests and how to handle those alongside our routers; and finally, another group research task where we had an hour and a half to research a topic then present it back to a group of thirty! My group did a short presentation on HTTP status codes and how they relate to our current coding focuses, and how you can add them into your code with something like `res.statusCode` which returns the HTTP status code of your response.

Not too much – compared to the last three days, at least – to take in code-wise, but the presentation and the mindset session both provided a lot of learning and information, and took a lot out of me. Today was the first time this week I felt a little bit more unsure in one of the code workshops, but I think that’s down to just having more syntax to remember and keep straight rather than discomfort with the logic.

Tomorrow’s the hackathon and my enablement meeting. Excited to build something with what we’ve been learning, and my partner this week is really good with the code and easy to get on with. So, should be a fun project!

**Friday (Day 37).** Hackathon Friday!

Going to keep it short because I feel a bit under the weather, but we combined everything we knew today to build a RESTful API that fulfilled all the CRUD criteria! Me and my partner did really well and got really far into the bonus tasks, and learned a lot of new things, and I’m really proud of us! The practice I’ve been putting in through the week of trying to build an API in parts, from scratch, after class, has really helped. It was a lot of effort, and I’m kind of worn out now, but it went pretty well!

No mentor meeting today, but had my enablement coach meeting today, and that was really good! It was a great chance to review the first quarter of the course, look at places where I could improve or keep on pushing, get advice on areas I might need support in, and take stock of things that have been strengths so I can make sure I prioritise those habits in my workflow.

Got cracking on the recap task tonight because I want some time to relax over the weekend. Really enjoyed back-end a lot more than I thought I would, and excited to learn some more next week.

**Saturday (Day 38).** Added some middleware and more annotations to the API I'm building for this week's middleware task, and watched a few talks and read some writing by Kyle Simpson, who's going to be doing a talk at SoC on Monday afternoon. Otherwise, took it easy, as feeling a bit under the weather!

**Sunday (Day 39).** Tinkered with a few side projects, organised my notes and went back over code from last week, and also getting started on some of the exercises that Joe talked about in this week's mindset session to help promote mental resilience and strengthen your inner champion. Maybe not the kind of heavy code that this challenge calls for in its most strict format! However, I think it's important to keep in mind that a big part of learning something new or actively seeking change isn't just doing the thing itself. It's also about reflecting back on what you've done, and making conscious choices about where you'll be going next in your journey.

And, less philosophically, sometimes, you're just tired or sick and need a break! Been thinking about what Joe said in our mindset session this week. He talked about how there are three kinds of inner critic that he thinks are really common with most people: the perfectionist, the people-pleaser, and the pusher. People whose inner critics are more pushers tend to overwork themselves because they hate not feeling productive, and they find it hard to relax because there's always another job to do or something else they could be pushing themselves to achieve. There are positives to being diligent about progress in this way, but the negative impacts if you don't have any balance are easy to imagine. I definitely saw parts of myself in what he was saying, so today, I've set a deadline for when I'm going to stop working this afternoon, and me and a friend are going to watch a very bad cartoon show and one of the cringier live action Disney remakes to close the evening.

**Takeaways.** First week working with server-side code! I think what was important this week is that even though I was very apprehensive about starting work on back-end code, I knew that my mentor and a lot of other developers really enjoy working with it, and so I decided to approach the work with conscious openness. No, there's no way anyone can fully understand a whole new field after a week, and have no mistakes while working with the code! But they can learn a lot about it, and work out what they don't know, so that they can carry on learning in the future. And they can also have fun! Which I absolutely have. Excited to carry on building on what we've learned on Monday.

# Week Five

**Week summary.** This week was my fifth week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days forty through forty-six of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. Things we worked on this week included: learning about the history and structure of databases; what SQL and postgreSQL are and how to use them in order to query databases; a variety of SQL statements, queries, and operations; using Heroku to host a cloud database, and then, how to combine this database with everything else we've learned the past five weeks to make a live server and RESTful API!

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 40).** Met my new programming partner for the week, and they’re also from Yorkshire, which was very exciting (not many of us kicking about on the course). Then, we got started with an introduction to the history of databases and their place in the ecosystem, as well as the different constructions of database you can have, and ways of accessing them. We’re going to be using relational databases during the bootcamp, and we’re going to be interacting with them using postgreSQL, which we started learning a bit of the logic and syntax of today!

A big part of the day today, though, was a talk and question and answer session that we had with Kyle Simpson, author of the ‘You Don’t Know JavaScript’ series of books. We got a sneak preview of a new talk he’s going to be debuting at a conference in Greece in about a week, called ‘Confessions from an Imposter’. He covered a lot of ground, but one thing that stuck with me was when he talked to us about how we often see imposters as a negative thing, but then, consider the etymology of the word: an imposter is an empiric, or someone who focuses on evidence and practical experience. If we learn through experimentation and doing, then isn’t that a positive? He also talked a lot about accessibility in tech, and the personal responsibility we all hold to build software and contribute to the ecosystem in a people-oriented way. His closing advice was to remember that “everything you do, first and foremost, is a human activity you are doing with other humans. Optionally, we communicate through technology, but we are not serving the machines. The machines serve us. What you can do can so far surpass what the computer can do. Information is a byproduct; the relationship is what matters.” It was a really great talk, and I really took a lot away from it.

I also had another great chat with my mentor about what we’ve both been up to, how he approaches the trajectory of his career, and ways of thinking about things like long-term programming goals and trying to get better at switching off. This morning before class, too, I finally figured out a little irritation I was having with a JS array in my portfolio code, and added to my contact page! So, all in all, a good day!

**Tuesday (Day 41).** Learned how to format a few more statements, create tables, and use joins in postgreSQL today, and we did a lot of different workshops and puzzles and things to practice the logic and syntax of those! Nothing terribly exciting to say about it, but sometimes learning is just about getting in some good, solid practice on things. I’m going to carry on practicing and reading the postgreSQL docs - the length of which is very, very funny to me - and then I’m going to do a little code on some side projects, and call it a day.

**Wednesday (Day 42).** Today, we learned how to combine postgreSQL and Heroku together to host a cloud-based database, which we then hooked up to our servers we’ve been working on. We then did some more modularising, and started learning a little bit about parametising data and sanitising it so that we can make our code secure. We also had a talk from Ricky at OALO Security about his journey into cybersecurity, how it works, and his experiences on the job.

The code itself, logically and syntactically, wasn’t totally unreachable, but definitely there were a lot of moving parts to keep straight today. I know a lot of people found today really challenging, and I think the energy and optimism definitely flagged for people at different parts of the day. All in all, I think me and my pair programmer did really well with it. We didn’t get through every workshop task, but we got a good chunk done, and we coded in a few extra features regarding correct routing, importing and exporting in a few other files that helped our project reach best practices. Those were the concrete things we did, and while I think I’m following it and absorbing it fairly well, it was definitely a lot today. Despite a bit of a grind, though, I’m still having a lot of fun with it all.

Since I finished my MSc last year, I haven’t read or written really, which is strange for me. But I felt burnt out on it, among other things, so I put it aside for a while. Getting into programming has been surprisingly energising, though, and recently I've been going back to some things I'd otherwise lost my hold on. Today, I went back through some of my old poetry books. In ‘Go to the Limits of Your Longing’, Rainer Maria Rilke writes:

> You, sent out beyond your recall, go to the limits of your longing. Embody me. Flare up like a flame and make big shadows I can move in. Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror. Just keep going. No feeling is final. Don’t let yourself lose me. Nearby is the country they call life. You will know it by its seriousness. Give me your hand.

Today was a hard day, but soon it will be over. The birds are singing their goodnights outside my window, the sky is dusky blue and quieting pink, and nearby is the country they call life. The sun rises again tomorrow! I am reaching out!

**Thursday (Day 43).** Worked on the same workshops from yesterday, just a little slower, and with some recaps over the harder bits. Also, had a really interesting, affirming talk from Will Peachey, and another mindset session with Joe about using the GROW model to confront difficulties on your journey. A tiring day, and not much new to report, since it was more about developing on what we've already covered, but just need to get better at. Did a lot of work in class and a lot of hours after, though, working on the code and getting different bits and bobs to work or become clearer. Some days are sprints, some days are marathons!

**Friday (Day 44).** Hackathon Friday!

This week, our job was to build a RESTful API server using node.js, express, postgres and a load of other big and little technologies. And we did really well! We got stuck right at the end trying to fix our routers up, but our plan and documentation was really solid, and we largely made good, consistent progress. We coded with good readability, and when we did hit errors, we tested to narrow down exactly what part of our routers were being problematic, so I'm still proud of what we managed on a difficult week. With a bit more time, I think we'd have gotten it down.

Also had a great mentor meeting! My mentor's on a holiday-and-hackathon trip right now, which sounds very cool and very fun, and is a concept I'm absolutely going to steal so that I can work on bullying my friend group into doing one too. When I've eventually got time to be going on a holiday-hackathon (Holithon? Hackiday?), that is, and also I guess when any of them learn how to code. Small setback. But yeah! Had a really helpful talk too about how sexism and ableism manifest in the industry, some of the kinds of things you can do to advocate for yourself, and other bits and bobs that I wanted to get his opinion on.

**Saturday (Day 45).** Got up early and worked on the recap task for a couple of hours. We had to start from scratch and build the exact same thing as yesterday, which felt a little daunting, but it went well, and! Excitingly! I figured out my router problem from yesterday! I wasn't quite getting my async/await pairs on the routers themselves right, and fixing those fixed the problem we had been having of our payload showing up in the console but not on the webpage. Took a break after I figured that out to do some gardening and life admin, but going to carry on doing some programming for fun later!

**Sunday (Day 46).** Family dinner at dad's today, so not too much to report back on. Took my fix for the routers from the recap task, and implemented it on the routers from the hackathon, and everything looks much happier and less shouty in the console. Did a little bit of work on my website – had a study swap session with a friend yesterday, where they gave me feedback on some code and I gave them feedback on their dissertation, so was keeping that in mind – but otherwise, a chill day!

<br />

**Takeaways.** I think what consistently struck me this week is how fun I'm finding programming, and the trial and error process. We learned a lot of new technical things this week that I'm excited to move forward with, too. Though, it's the conversations that I've had with people that have been especially stand-out for me. My pair programmer had a really pragmatic attitude toward building and the learning process, which was really grounding to work alongside. I especially appreciated my mentor meetings this week too. They're always great, but it really hit home this week the kind of difference that attitude and perspective can make. My mentor's sense of calmness, malleability, self-advocacy and enthusiasm are always re-energising, but were particularly helpful at this juncture, and I'm going to try and mindfully, consciously centre a similar energy more myself.

# Week Six

**Week summary.** This week was my sixth week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days forty-seven through fifty-three of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. Things we worked on this week included: using Jest, Supertest and Cypress to perform unit tests, automated server testing, and E2E testing on a variety of different programming projects; how to code using TDD, and when this is and isn't a useful model to follow during development; why we test, what to test, and concepts like code coverage and what a well-tested or robust project might look like.

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 47).** This week, our focus is on testing software, and different ways to approach building testing methods, principles and best practices into our work. We had an introductory talk from Nadeem Shabir at Talis today about software testing, as well as some really solid life advice. Also, we learned a little about the uses and purpose of software testing, and got some practice in with our first testing framework, Jest.

New things are always a little hard to get to grips with at first, but the workshops went pretty well! To be transparent, though, this is the first day on the course where my emotions have felt primarily rooted in anxiety. Nebulously so, and not connected to any worries about the programming as much as just tiredness catching up with me, I think. But still, the feeling's present. So! Where I'd normally do a lot of extra work after class ends and push myself to carry on going for a couple of hours, I think I need a break, so I'm going to try and take one this week. Shorter log entries than usual, then, but it is what it is. Catch you soon!

**Tuesday (Day 48).** Did some workshopping today in Jest, following TDD principles. Also, had a really great introduction to Cypress – a technology for E2E testing – from Jordan and Robert on the Cypress developer experience team! Still feeling a bit shaky, but better than yesterday. Just trying to get some code admin done and get through the week. Looking forward to getting a bit of free time to work on some side projects over the long weekend, though, and the chats I've got scheduled with my enablement coach and my mentor towards the end of the week.

**Wednesday (Day 49).** Tested with Cypress properly for the first time, and used supertest to test an API server. My meeting with my enablement coach was pushed to next week, but that can't be helped. Otherwise, though, this is the last day of the working week – it's the long bank holiday weekend for the Platinum Jubilee – and in retrospect, coding has gone really well this week! My pair programmer has been very sharp and capable, and we've been able to get some really good work done on all our workshops. We've been given a longer recap task than usual this week, to get some extra practice in considering we're missing two taught days, but it all looks pretty doable.

**Thursday (Day 50).** Worked on some workshops from the week through the day, and got some programming done for the recap task. Testing is a little dry, but necessary, and thankfully a pretty accessible facet of programming compared to some concepts which are harder to grasp or execute. I also had a meeting with my mentor at the end of the day. Even on weeks when I don't necessarily have anything technical to ask about, I always find mentor meetings to be a part of my day that really helps re-energise and re-centre me, and puts a lot of things into perspective. Keeping in mind Nadeem's advice on Monday about not going so above and beyond that you exhaust yourself, and my mentor's advice that sometimes you have to literally just do anything other than programming for a bit, and that's what I'm going to do.

**Friday (Day 51).** Didn’t do much today! I tinkered with a few configurations for the automated tests in my workshops, and also started reading some articles about React. Spent most of the day out with my mum, shopping for yarn and cooking. Feeling better rested and ready to get back to it at my usual level!

**Saturday (Day 52).** Got a lot of work in today. Finished up my testing workshops as much as I am happy with – they're not perfect, but they're functional and I'm pleased with them, which is enough – and then read into some more resources on React, and got a lot of work done on some side projects and non-SoC programming. Took a look at jQuery for the first time, but it wasn't quite working out as I wanted it to, so I'm going to come back for it for the project I was using it on another time. Tomorrow, I'm going to do a little bit more programming and my usual coding admin (sorting out this log and tidying up notes etc.) in the morning, and then I'm going to close my laptop and do other stuff!

**Sunday (Day 53).** Tinkered on my portfolio side project some more, and doing my code admin, and updating this log. Reflecting back on this week, I think having the tiredness hit me now was well-timed for a longer weekend, but also has made me a bit more conscious of some of my working flaws. In general, I push myself to get a lot of work done, and to keep up a certain pace and level of quality that is absolutely achievable in moderation, but maybe not twelve hours a day, every day. Taking a slower approach this week has given me a chance to regroup, and while I'm ready to get back to it on Monday, I think maybe I'm going to be more conscious about having extended non-programming breaks on my weekends going forward.

<br />

**Takeaways.** I was talking to my mentor about the difficulty of pulling yourself away from code, whether it's because you're having fun or it's not finished, and he talked about how sometimes, even if you get to the end of the day and there's a big problem you still haven't figured out, you just have to tell yourself that your workday finishes at five, turn off the computer, and go and do something else. Maybe 'take it easier' isn't the most on-brand message to commit, but if you're reading this and wondering to yourself whether you should take a day off? A couple hours of rest aren't going to end the world. You've made it this far already, and you're going to carry on being just fine, even if you pick up what you're doing on Monday instead.
