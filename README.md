# 100 Days & SoC Bootcamp

This is a log of my learning experiences and progress while attempting the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge and attending the School of Code programming bootcamp. Inspired by Kallaway's [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) and Katie Hawcutt's School of Code [bootcamp diary](https://github.com/katiehawcutt/100DaysOfCode).

I started at School of Code about a fortnight after I'd begun the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge, so the start days for both don't align exactly. I'll be updating and classifying my logs weekly for the sake of tidiness, but I'll summarise the first eleven days of the coding challenge here too anyway.

Thanks for stopping by!

# Before the Bootcamp

Small summaries of what I worked on for the first eleven days of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge, prior to starting with the School of Code. Before starting with the School of Code, I would have called myself comfortable-ish with HTML and CSS – a by-product of growing up as an eternally-online teenager – but I've never had any experience with programming proper. Excited to see how this changes going forward!

<summary>Day 1 – Day 11 (#100DaysOfCode)</summary>
<br />

**Day 1.** I put together all the HTML for the Technical Documentation Page project with the freeCodeCamp, which is part of the projects you have to complete for their Responsive Web Design certificate. I got the page to pass all of the required tests, so work on making it not quite as hideous with CSS begins tomorrow!

**Day 2.** I added all of the CSS to the Technical Documentation Page for the freeCodeCamp certification and successfully submitted it. Then, I began working on putting together the HTML for the Portfolio Page project for the same certification. Only one left, and then the certificate's done!

**Day 3.** Carried on putting together the HTML for the Portfolio Page project and tidied up the CSS a little bit, sorting out all of the grids and the colour scheme.

**Day 4.** I finished putting together the HTML and the CSS for the Portfolio Page, and it's not perfect, but it passes all the tests and I'm happy with it for now. Which means the Responsive Web Design certificate is finally complete! Going to spend some more time going over the CSS and making things a little neater, before starting the JavaScript module tomorrow.

**Day 5.** Began working through the basic JavaScript module and exercises on freeCodeCamp today! I've only worked with JavaScript a tiny little bit before now, while I was making some event listeners and buttons in my SheCodes Basic final project, so it's all very new. Clicked a wrong back button on the browser and lost all my progress, so had to everything today twice over, but I guess if nothing else it was inbuilt revision time.

**Day 6.** Worked through more of the basic JavaScript module with freeCodeCamp, just hit the bit on arrays!

**Day 7.** Still working through the basic JavaScript module, about halfway through the first one now.

**Day 8.** Still working through the basic JavaScript module, got up to Else If statements.

**Day 9.** Still working through the basic JavaScript module, almost very nearly finished.

**Day 10.** Split today between doing a bit of work on the JavaScript module, and reading a little bit around UI & UX.

**Day 11.** Updated some bits and bobs on GitHub to clean it up, refreshed some CSS projects, and reviewed some git learning materials. Otherwise, taking it easy before the bootcamp begins tomorrow. Excited! Nervous! Still doing it anyway!

# Week One

**Week summary.** This week was my first week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days twelve through eighteen of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Things we worked on this week included: programming and workflow concepts like algorithms, computational thinking, and agile vs. waterfall team set-ups; CSS basics, including selectors, classes and IDs, positioning, creating shapes and images; linking together stylesheets, HTML and JS files; using git and Github to collaborate with others and version control; JavaScript functions, for loops, while loops, if and else if statements and other basics; unweighted squat record (morning ritual).

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 12).** First day of class! Had some introductions to the curriculum, and basic tenets of agile team flow and computational thinking. I also met my pair programmer for the week, and we spent some time doing some CSS games and exercises to get used to pair programming. It was a fun and a very new experience compared to how I've usually coded before (hunched over a CSS stylesheet in my room, furiously scowling while I'm trying to get a website to stop looking quite so ugly). Another thing that felt new but also really energising was the fact that the bootcamp really is a community, both of current students, alumni, mentors, and lots of other folks. It was great to meet some of the larger team, and to get to know other people in the same boat as myself.

Outside of the things we went over at SoC today, I decided to pause on the freeCodeCamp JavaScript module for a bit, just until we hit that part of the course, so I don't get my wires crossed. Really great first day, though!

**Tuesday (Day 13).** Spent some time getting used to using git, GitHub, and editing CSS and HTML with stylesheets. We learned about computational thinking some more, and how to break down webpages into their design elements so that we could reverse-engineer how they were coded. Me and my programming partner then put together a mini playscript by pushing and pulling an .md back and forth over GitHub, and practiced building a koala together out of CSS.

Using what we’d learned from the day's presentations, we took the thumbnail we were given of how the koala was meant to look, and broke him down into his design elements, making notes on what different bits of the HTML and what CSS properties and functionalities could be used to build him. We put together the shape code we needed first for the building blocks of the koala’s face, and then added the colours in.

Git and GitHub were a bit challenging at first, but the more you practice, the easier they become. My main downfall is accidentally cloning repos down into the last directory I was previously working in. Hoping that becomes muscle memory and I stop doing it so much soon!

**Wednesday (Day 14).** Looking back at my daily tweet for today's entry about my _#100DaysOfCode_ progress, and all it says is 'JavaScript more like JavaRIP'. Luckily, my actual diary has a bit more detail to it. We got started learning JavaScript, and tried building a few functions and a password checker. We got the first half of it to work - if a correct password is entered - but not if an incorrect password is entered. The loop kept cutting out halfway through.

I spent a good bit of the evening trying to figure it out, but I'm trying to be mindful of something Chris Meah said on our first day. We're trying to build habits that will sustain us through a whole career. It is not worth burning out while learning code, and honestly, presenteeist exhaustion is only a net detrimental in all aspects. So! I stopped working on it and did some crocheting instead. I also sent an email reaching out to my in-industry mentor to set up our first meeting today, so will be able to report back on that soon!

**Thursday (Day 15).** Carried on playing with the password checker and made some progress, and set up the meeting officially with my mentor for Friday after class! Me and my programming partner also did some more challenges today working with arrays and objects, and managed to get through all our set tasks for our workshops before time ran out, which we were proud of! We also both felt a lot more comfortable with git and GitHub, using the command line and the terminal, and VSC. Little things, maybe, but having that progress in this short timeframe feels good and solid.

We got the CSS koala from the other day to look right with set px values – we've been working on him on-off through the week – but when we tried to make him reactive today in our out-of-class time, he tragically lost his various eyeballs and ears and noses and such to all four corners of the viewport. Learning doesn't come without trials, but fixing him up will be a weekend job!

**Friday (Day 16).** First hackathon ever! Our goal was to build a rock-paper-scissors game in JavaScript, which was a bit fast-and-loose, but it worked, which is what matters! Excited to carry on perfecting it at the weekend. Had a lot of fun with my programming partner and I think we learned a lot, both technically about JS, as well as more broadly about how to work as a team building a technical project to a deadline. At the end of the day, we presented our progress back to a small group of other teams, and being able to look at other people’s code, talk about our different processes, and see first-hand how creative an endeavour coding can be was really interesting and useful. I also had my introductory meeting with my in-industry mentor! It was really interesting to hear about his journey and experiences, and I'm looking forward to chatting again next week.

This week is going to be a long weekend – Bank Holiday – so we've got a good bit of recap work to do, but I think I'm going to have another crack at the JavaScript freeCodeCamp module if I have some spare time. If nothing else, it'll be good revision over basics.

Overall, the first week at the School of Code was exhausting, but very productive. I really love learning, and it's really exciting to get stuck into something totally new. Looking forward to next week!

**Saturday (Day 17).** Did lots of coding today, putting together working functions from workshops I didn't finish in the week and wrapping them all up. Also polished off a fork of our rock-paper-scissors game in JS, adding in username and score tracking variables! Also very nearly finished building that password authenticator I was struggling with earlier in the week. It's been giving me untold grief and woe, boundless aggravation and tears etc. and such, but once this last loop is fixed, it's all over for that authenticator.

**Sunday (Day 18).** Wrapped up the authenticator! The koala is saved! Also signed up to Codewars, and finished up some last little projects I wanted to revise from in the week.

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** Lots of them this week! Unsurprising, considering it's the first week of this whole experience. I think a few things really stuck with me, though, and I want to make sure I carry them with me as I go on.

Firstly, this week really emphasised to me that things don't have to be perfect on the first try, or even the second or third. Getting something to work is the very first goal to pursue: you can always refactor afterwards.

The process of taking multiple passes at things, and coming back to them again and again – whether to learn, revise, or build – was fruitful and educational too. My mum always tells me that God loves a trier, which Google tells me maybe is not necessarily a complimentary phrase! But she also always tells me that all you can do is your best, and so long as you're doing your best, that will be enough, which feels closer to the sentiment I want to keep in mind this week: so long as you're putting yourself wholly into things, you will get back out what you have committed.

# Week Two

**Week summary.** This week was my second week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days nineteen through twenty-five of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. Things we worked on this week included: the DOM, and interacting with and manipulating the DOM; event listeners and more functions and loops in JavaScript; fetching data from APIs, navigating their data, and using them to build more interactive and responsive web content; introduction to the call stack; asynchronous coding, CSS flexboxes and display elements.

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 19).** Bank Holiday, so no SoC today! Carried on going over workshops from earlier, though, worked on some for loops and arrays for a bit to cement my learning, and I did a few levels on Codewars. Took it easier, though, today: did some gardening! Turnips are looking grand! Radishes are looking dire! Such is life!

**Tuesday (Day 20).** New weekly pair programmer today! In the morning, we had a great talk today from some SoC alumni who now work at Wise, including the same Katie Hawcutt whose GitHub learning diary inspired this one! Getting their insight and reflections was really useful, and it was interesting to see how broadly they'd diversified after gradutating, even within the same company.

Otherwise, class was focused on learning about the DOM, and working with event listeners and loops some more to incorporate the DOM into our current experience with JavaScript. Did a lot of post-bootcamp work on the day's workshops to try and get to grips with it all, which did not happen first time around, but it is what it is. The first day learning something new is never the day you are totally comfortable with it.

Connected with some other bootcampers outside of classes too, to chat about how things are going and other bits and bobs. One thing I really do like about SoC is how diverse the bootcamp is, and how the community is made of people from all walks of life, pursuing a common goal together.

**Wednesday (Day 21).** Found out what an API is today, and used one for the very first time! Me and my programming partner built a quote generator using the Kanye API, and got some more practice with JavaScript functions to interact with APIs and to store data. We also had an introduction to the call stack, and using the DOM to manipulate HTML and CSS.

After yesterday – which, in all honesty, was a challenging day – it felt like a real win when me and my programming partner got up to speed with the day's workshops and stretch tasks pretty quickly. Pride comes before the fall, of course, but I'm really proud of the team today nonetheless!

**Thursday (Day 22).** My instinct was right, hilariously and tragically – another tough one! We had a workshop where we had to try and do a virtual space-themed escape room, using fetch requests with APIs to call for and send back information about some rocket ship launch codes.

What held us up wasn't a technical challenge at all, in the end, but we were trying to over-solve a problem that did not need solving. We tried for a good while to display the information from our API in various onscreen formats, none of which was necessary – we just needed to fetch the data (which we actually had done in a comically short amount of time at the beginning of the workshop, incidentally) and read it manually in the console. On the plus side, learning not to over-solve problems is a lesson best learned earlier rather than later, at least! (And it was a little funny when one of the coaches pointed our needless extra work out.)

Tomorrow is the hackathon, and I'm a bit nervous for it this week, but you just have to take every day as it comes. I finished some bits of code that had seemed really troublesome at the beginning of the week today in my spare time, so if nothing else, I know things are sinking in.

I also started an extra project that I’m going to try and work on in my spare time. It’s a refactored version of last week's rock-paper-scissors, except it’s going to be run through events and the DOM instead of just through the console and alerts and prompts that we were building with previously. Funny to think back on how much you can learn even in the shortest timeframe.

**Friday (Day 23).** Hackathon Friday!

The challenge today was, very broadly, to build a project with some APIs using fetch requests, using a couple of different APIs suggested by SoC.

A very non-specific target, so! We started with Plan 1.0. We decided that the core of whatever we built should use at least one example of every new thing we'd learnt or worked on the past week: event listeners, loops that interact with the DOM and visuals of the webpage, using asynchronous code to fetch and navigate data, and potentially the setTimeout and setInterval functions.

After we knew we wanted to use these specific elements, we moved onto Plan 1.1. Thinking about MVPs and agile working, we decided to start off by building a basic webpage that took input from one button to begin with, and generated a profile of a pokemon from the PokeAPI. After we got all of that together and working, we then moved on to implementing more features and slightly more complex code, writing up new mini-plans and stretch goals as we went, and keeping a note at the bottom of our code of refactoring ideas and helpful things we learned in the process of building.

Our ultimate project ended up being a 'guess that pokemon' game. The computer would generate a random pokemon profile by pulling from the PokeAPI. We disguised some of the data we'd stored in onscreen variables from the user's view, so they would have to try and guess what pokemon profile had been generated based on limited information. If they guessed right, the full profile and a congratulation message would be revealed, and if not, they would receive the failure message instead. My teammate wanted to work on their CSS knowledge, so they added some cool styling features to the first iteration of the final product, and I learned a lot in fixing one of our JavaScript issues while they were hard at work. We did a short presentation back to a smaller group of thirty people about our progress and work at the end of the day, and it was really nice to show what we'd accomplished, what we'd hope to accomplish with more time, where some of our challenges had been, and then to compare that with the other teams and their experiences.

We didn't reach all our stretch goals on the day, but we made a lot of progress from where we first started. I'm really proud of what we built, and I think a real strength of our team – and a working habit I'm going to take away from this week – is the process of methodical but adaptable planning and progress review.

I also had another chat with my mentor after class, and got some really good advice on a few questions I'd been mulling over in the week, and some interesting resource pointers. It was a pretty long day, but I wanted to get through some work and was feeling pretty energised after the hackathon, so I also got through the weekend’s recap tasks in the evening.

**Saturday (Day 24).** Finished off the bonus tasks for the weekend recap tasks! Built a to-do list maker and organiser with JavaScript! Got some gardening done and planted some baby spinach and kale and parsley! Watched a few videos on flexbox! Spent most of the evening typing up this whole document up until today's date! README.ception!

**Sunday (Day 25).** Woke up early and spent the first part of the morning converting last week's rock-paper-scissors game from being console-based only to being interactive with the DOM and displaying on the webpage. Haven't done any styling yet, but I've got some ideas noted down that I'm going to try out later or next week.

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** Don't over-engineer! And it's great practice to plan well in the beginning, starting small and clean and functional, before returning to your original plans at later intervals in order to re-evaluate and stretch for newer, loftier goals. Sometimes, the best thing to do to when you're struggling with a coding problem is to put it down for a bit to let your brain turn over it in a new way later.

# Week Three

**Week summary.** This week was my third week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days twenty-six through thirty-two of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. Things we worked on this week included: UX/UI fundamentals; the design thought process; agile methodology and the agile manifesto, and integrating UX and agile working methods; user-centred design; user research with things like personas, stories, journey maps and other research exercises; Disney ideation; prototyping and low and high fidelity wireframing; accessibility in design and experience; deep and active listening, and overcoming listening challenges in teams; more advanced CSS.

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 26).** It’s UX/UI week!

This morning was mostly a talk by Paaven Buddhdev, about ‘Do U(X) Believe in Magic?’ It was really cool and insightful to hear about his journey into his role, and the experience of working as a UX/UI designer and consultant. I also met my programming partner for the week, and we went through some presentations with Liz about agile working, the history of agile working, and different ways of working with agile thinking at their heart. To close the day, we did our feedback for last week, and we also played a game called cantunsee.space, which was meant to show us about the small details that can impact a piece of UI design, and how they all come together to make or break a whole.

We didn't get any JavaScript or too much CSS done during hours today, so I did a few hours' work after class finished, and worked on fine-tuning the rock-paper-scissors game that I started editing last week.

**Tuesday (Day 27).** Had a really great talk today from Adam Fairholm and Javaid Karim at Nester about how their UX/UI process has been for developing their investment app, and how to balance the needs of the user and customer against the needs of the business (considering the FCA, legal requirements, etc.)

I also attended a great talk at Config about ‘Designing for Neurodiversity’ by Treyce Meredith, and how we can centre success and abundance in our design, and not just the compliance of access.

Otherwise, we did some workshops on Disney ideation and user testing in order to refine user personas, user stories, and build and design a product in an agile way. Then, we did a CSS workshop where we learned how to use CSS variables and how to set toggle variables, for things like dark modes etc.

Really enjoying UX/UI week! I want to make sure all the recent coding experience sticks in my mind though while we're focusing more on design thinking. So, this morning, I got up early and cleaned up some of the CSS and the JavaScript for the rock-paper-scissors game.

**Wednesday (Day 28).** Today, we had a talk from Luke with Immediate Media - the people who did the website coding for the Radio Times and BBC Good Foods - and heard about his journey, as well as how he hires and works as the company’s lead UI developer! We also learned about user interfaces, wire-framing, and got to use some user interfacing tools to create a mock-up of our projects we were working on yesterday. We learned a bit more about keeping your CSS files tidy, and we did a little bit of reading in the docs.

Outside of class, I also got my dark mode toggle on my rock-paper-scissors game to work, and so once I’ve coded some aesthetics onto the actual button itself, I’m going to leave that one alone for a bit and start building a new project!

**Thursday (Day 29).** A long day! Had our usual mindset session with Joe, which, this week, was about learning how to listen deeply and actively in order to overcome moments of friction in a team.

Then, we had a talk from an ex-bootcamper, Olivia Winteringham, who is now a UX/UI designer at Santander! Apparently, she doesn’t do that much coding at all in her job, but it’s very social, and there’s a lot of interaction with customers, users, stakeholders, other teams, things like that. It was really interesting to hear about her journey, and how the experience of working in UX/UI can still be creative, but maybe not in the way that you’d first think. More about creative problem-solving, than necessarily having to be great at illustration.

Then, we learned a bit about ordering CSS and using flexbox some more with Helena. The coaches alluded to media queries, but didn’t go into them. I’m already a bit familiar, but more experience would be nice, so maybe I’ll look into it at the weekend for a refresher.

And, finally, in the afternoon me and my pair programmer this week got together with another team to build a user journey map for an imaginary app - a competitor to Expedia and Kayak - and then presented what we’d worked on and learned back to one of the coding coaches and a group of about thirty other people.

Went well, and I think our team came off really polished! Glad I could help us present in a clean, collated way. I’d like to get quicker at talking, but I think since I finished my MSc, my presentation, planning and teamwork skills have definitely levelled up, and presenting in front of people doesn't generally feel daunting anymore. I'm sure that will change when we do the big presentations at the end of the course! But I'm hoping that getting all this practice in now, and sticking to my process – making sure I've got a short, solid plan, and I know my key points – puts me in good stead.

But yeah! Hackathon tomorrow! It’s going to be based around making a fake landing page for a website that me and and my partner ideated today. Looking forward to it!

**Friday (Day 30).** Hackathon Friday once again!

A very UX/UI centred day today. It was our job to take some ideas we had for a landing page, and then put them through the design thinking wringer. The emphasis was less on getting to complete the code, and more about user research, and using that research to centre our approach to the project at hand. It was very interesting, and I loved the combination of methodical approach with creative problem-solving!

Ultimately, our team didn’t get into the CSS and HTML, but it wasn't the focus of the task, and besides, we got very close! We got to planning out our high fidelity wireframes and looking at palettes and mood associations with typography, and I think we really did well.

After class, I had my usual Friday chat with my mentor. Another really interesting talk that I really enjoyed. We talked about the ecological impact of coding and software development, and how companies do - or do not - do their part to try and mitigate it, as well as levels of personal responsibility for coding in a green way. We also talked about his preference for back-end work, and about the mechanics of how game code is written, and how the IDE differs in game programming, compared to regular IDEs.

This weekend’s recap task is to begin planning a portfolio, so that’s what I’m going to do today! And tomorrow too probably, but I want to at least get through a bit of work this evening.

Really loved the week. Apprehensive but excited to try server-side programming next week. Took a long time to install nvm, but hopefully that was the first and last nightmare on this auspicious (or not) day!

**Saturday (Day 31).** Spent all day on my planning and wireframes for the portfolio website! I think I probably could've put less effort into it, for the sake of passing the task, but I really want to finish this project and have it be version 1.0 of my portfolio for the end of the course. So, I put the hours in! Tragically, I missed seeing out historic performance in the Eurovision live, and I kind of do regret doing so much work today. There's a big family thing on Sunday, though, so I guess it's like Liz always says: trade-offs for everything. You can't fit it all in! But you can do your best!

**Sunday (Day 32).** Finished the high-fidelity wireframes for the first draft of my portfolio. I'm going to put them in a repo on my GitHub by themselves once I've coded a first-draft of the CSS, HTML and JS, but [here's a sneak peek](https://www.figma.com/proto/VjKqj0v019CX4fdlSRjErL/W3-Hifi-Wireframe?node-id=9%3A63&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=9%3A63). I'm going to do a little bit more work on another JavaScript project – the cat treat randomiser my sister asked me to make – and then I'm going to relax for the evening. Back-end work starts tomorrow, got to make sure I'm rested!

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** I wrote down so many quotes from our guest speakers this week, and from the Config conference, but a few are really sticking with me, so I want to note them here to centre them in my thoughts and process. First, I loved how Paavan connected UX and magic, and how he emphasised that UX is about storytelling, attention, and wonder. Treyce Meredith did a really good talk about designing for neurodiversity at the Figma conference too, and he emphasised how features should be abundant, how we should make sure we are forgiving in the interface, make sure the tools we make are nurturing in order to encourage creativity, and how we should go beyond accessibility compliance to think about accessibility success. It was really great to be able to contribute to several teams this week, and I'm looking forward to more fruitful, collaborative work in the future.

<br />

# Week Four

**Week summary.** This week was my fourth week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days thirty-three through thirty-nine of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. Things we worked on this week included: learning about node, npm, nvm and how they interact; vertical and horizontal scaling in servers; how servers work asynchronously; CommonJS and ES6 import and export syntax and methods; how to modularise server code and separate concerns; building functional routers and models; building CRUD functions; building APIs RESTfully; using Postman to test servers; built a couple of API servers!

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 33).** First ever day working with back-end tech!

Met my new weekly programming partner, and we got to know each other and gave each other mini presentations of what we’d been working on over the weekend. We had a recap task to do some research and create some wireframes and maybe a little bit of code for a personal portfolio and website. It was really cool to see how different concerns about the way we wanted to present ourselves, and who we were presenting to, changed how we approached the task in drastic ways. I think it’s also just fun to see how people see themselves, whether through their colour schemes or the other design choices they make.

Then, we spent a lot of the day going through demos and introductory talks and question-answer sessions about node, nvm, npm and nodist etc. We also learned a little bit more about the specifics of how servers work. Then, in the latter half of the day, we got to get some practice in by doing a workshop based on the chalk npm.

It was really fun! We got through the whole workshop pretty quickly, so we did some experimentation with other packages and we went through the full docs instead of just what we needed for the workshop. I’m sure it’s going to get much harder from now on, so I don’t want to jinx myself! But for a first introduction to back-end programming, I enjoyed today.

**Tuesday (Day 34).** We learned some more about node.js today, and then about how to use express to spin up servers, as well as about using nodemon to make it so that we don’t have to constantly kill and reboot the server every time we make file changes. We also worked through some workshops, where we created some .js files of information, imported and exported it into different .js files, and then spun up a server and made calls to it in order to access the information files we’d created. We learned about when to use commonjs and when to use ES6 in order to make these import and export requests too. We’re practicing this so that we can build up to creating our own API on Friday for the hackathon, I think!

I was really intimidated by the back-end before we started this week, but so far, it’s going pretty smoothly. I don’t think we’re doing anything too complex yet, comparatively, so maybe I won’t feel the same tomorrow! But I’m trying to be open to failure and experimentation with new things, and it’s really fun learning about the different elements of back-end programming. They can be really powerful, and I’m excited to learn more about them.

I got called on at the end of the day for the end-of-day reflections, and I said that the thing I took away from today was the value of not panicking. Which I can sometimes be hypocritical about - we all panic, me often, and about the tiniest things! But it’s okay to be bad at something, or not to get it the first couple of times. It’s about being open to learning, change, and being wrong. And when you’re panicking, you’ll never learn anything, you’ll just close up out of fear. Anyway, had a good day, did a bit of extra experimentation after class on using the servers, and pumped for tomorrow.

**Wednesday (Day 35).** We covered a lot of ground today! We learned about how to modularise our server code and use route handlers for server traffic, and how to send and receive information along these paths. We also learned how to respond to queries and non-get requests, learned a little bit about RESTful APIs and data organisation, and a little bit about other kinds of data requests, We’ll be workshopping those more tomorrow!

The theory is making sense to me, it’s just a lot of moving parts to piece together and remember all at once. A bit fiddly and lots of syntax! But enjoying it a lot, actually. I’m really excited for this week’s hackathon, and to use what we’ve learned in a side project when it comes to it.

**Thursday (Day 36).** Today, in order, we covered: Thursday mindset session with Joe about confronting your inner critic and turning them into your inner champion; workshop learning about what middleware is, the functions it provides in a server, and how to add one to our code; workshop on POST requests and how to handle those alongside our routers; and finally, another group research task where we had an hour and a half to research a topic then present it back to a group of thirty! My group did a short presentation on HTTP status codes and how they relate to our current coding focuses, and how you can add them into your code with something like `res.statusCode` which returns the HTTP status code of your response.

Not too much – compared to the last three days, at least – to take in code-wise, but the presentation and the mindset session both provided a lot of learning and information, and took a lot out of me. Today was the first time this week I felt a little bit more unsure in one of the code workshops, but I think that’s down to just having more syntax to remember and keep straight rather than discomfort with the logic.

Tomorrow’s the hackathon and my enablement meeting. Excited to build something with what we’ve been learning, and my partner this week is really good with the code and easy to get on with. So, should be a fun project!

**Friday (Day 37).** Hackathon Friday!

Going to keep it short because I feel a bit under the weather, but we combined everything we knew today to build a RESTful API that fulfilled all the CRUD criteria! Me and my partner did really well and got really far into the bonus tasks, and learned a lot of new things, and I’m really proud of us! The practice I’ve been putting in through the week of trying to build an API in parts, from scratch, after class, has really helped. It was a lot of effort, and I’m kind of worn out now, but it went pretty well!

No mentor meeting today, but had my enablement coach meeting today, and that was really good! It was a great chance to review the first quarter of the course, look at places where I could improve or keep on pushing, get advice on areas I might need support in, and take stock of things that have been strengths so I can make sure I prioritise those habits in my workflow.

Got cracking on the recap task tonight because I want some time to relax over the weekend. Really enjoyed back-end a lot more than I thought I would, and excited to learn some more next week.

**Saturday (Day 38).** Added some middleware and more annotations to the API I'm building for this week's middleware task, and watched a few talks and read some writing by Kyle Simpson, who's going to be doing a talk at SoC on Monday afternoon. Otherwise, took it easy, as feeling a bit under the weather!

**Sunday (Day 39).** Tinkered with a few side projects, organised my notes and went back over code from last week, and also getting started on some of the exercises that Joe talked about in this week's mindset session to help promote mental resilience and strengthen your inner champion. Maybe not the kind of heavy code that this challenge calls for in its most strict format! However, I think it's important to keep in mind that a big part of learning something new or actively seeking change isn't just doing the thing itself. It's also about reflecting back on what you've done, and making conscious choices about where you'll be going next in your journey.

And, less philosophically, sometimes, you're just tired or sick and need a break! Been thinking about what Joe said in our mindset session this week. He talked about how there are three kinds of inner critic that he thinks are really common with most people: the perfectionist, the people-pleaser, and the pusher. People whose inner critics are more pushers tend to overwork themselves because they hate not feeling productive, and they find it hard to relax because there's always another job to do or something else they could be pushing themselves to achieve. There are positives to being diligent about progress in this way, but the negative impacts if you don't have any balance are easy to imagine. I definitely saw parts of myself in what he was saying, so today, I've set a deadline for when I'm going to stop working this afternoon, and me and a friend are going to watch a very bad cartoon show and one of the cringier live action Disney remakes to close the evening.

<br />

**Takeaways.** First week working with server-side code! I think what was important this week is that even though I was very apprehensive about starting work on back-end code, I knew that my mentor and a lot of other developers really enjoy working with it, and so I decided to approach the work with conscious openness. No, there's no way anyone can fully understand a whole new field after a week, and have no mistakes while working with the code! But they can learn a lot about it, and work out what they don't know, so that they can carry on learning in the future. And they can also have fun! Which I absolutely have. Excited to carry on building on what we've learned on Monday.

# Week Five

**Week summary.** This week was my fifth week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days forty through forty-six of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. Things we worked on this week included: learning about the history and structure of databases; what SQL and postgreSQL are and how to use them in order to query databases; a variety of SQL statements, queries, and operations; using Heroku to host a cloud database, and then, how to combine this database with everything else we've learned the past five weeks to make a live server and RESTful API!

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 40).** Met my new programming partner for the week, and they’re also from Yorkshire, which was very exciting (not many of us kicking about on the course). Then, we got started with an introduction to the history of databases and their place in the ecosystem, as well as the different constructions of database you can have, and ways of accessing them. We’re going to be using relational databases during the bootcamp, and we’re going to be interacting with them using postgreSQL, which we started learning a bit of the logic and syntax of today!

A big part of the day today, though, was a talk and question and answer session that we had with Kyle Simpson, author of the ‘You Don’t Know JavaScript’ series of books. We got a sneak preview of a new talk he’s going to be debuting at a conference in Greece in about a week, called ‘Confessions from an Imposter’. He covered a lot of ground, but one thing that stuck with me was when he talked to us about how we often see imposters as a negative thing, but then, consider the etymology of the word: an imposter is an empiric, or someone who focuses on evidence and practical experience. If we learn through experimentation and doing, then isn’t that a positive? He also talked a lot about accessibility in tech, and the personal responsibility we all hold to build software and contribute to the ecosystem in a people-oriented way. His closing advice was to remember that “everything you do, first and foremost, is a human activity you are doing with other humans. Optionally, we communicate through technology, but we are not serving the machines. The machines serve us. What you can do can so far surpass what the computer can do. Information is a byproduct; the relationship is what matters.” It was a really great talk, and I really took a lot away from it.

I also had another great chat with my mentor about what we’ve both been up to, how he approaches the trajectory of his career, and ways of thinking about things like long-term programming goals and trying to get better at switching off. This morning before class, too, I finally figured out a little irritation I was having with a JS array in my portfolio code, and added to my contact page! So, all in all, a good day!

**Tuesday (Day 41).** Learned how to format a few more statements, create tables, and use joins in postgreSQL today, and we did a lot of different workshops and puzzles and things to practice the logic and syntax of those! Nothing terribly exciting to say about it, but sometimes learning is just about getting in some good, solid practice on things. I’m going to carry on practicing and reading the postgreSQL docs - the length of which is very, very funny to me - and then I’m going to do a little code on some side projects, and call it a day.

**Wednesday (Day 42).** Today, we learned how to combine postgreSQL and Heroku together to host a cloud-based database, which we then hooked up to our servers we’ve been working on. We then did some more modularising, and started learning a little bit about parametising data and sanitising it so that we can make our code secure. We also had a talk from Ricky at OALO Security about his journey into cybersecurity, how it works, and his experiences on the job.

The code itself, logically and syntactically, wasn’t totally unreachable, but definitely there were a lot of moving parts to keep straight today. I know a lot of people found today really challenging, and I think the energy and optimism definitely flagged for people at different parts of the day. All in all, I think me and my pair programmer did really well with it. We didn’t get through every workshop task, but we got a good chunk done, and we coded in a few extra features regarding correct routing, importing and exporting in a few other files that helped our project reach best practices. Those were the concrete things we did, and while I think I’m following it and absorbing it fairly well, it was definitely a lot today. Despite a bit of a grind, though, I’m still having a lot of fun with it all.

Since I finished my MSc last year, I haven’t read or written really, which is strange for me. But I felt burnt out on it, among other things, so I put it aside for a while. Getting into programming has been surprisingly energising, though, and recently I've been going back to some things I'd otherwise lost my hold on. Today, I went back through some of my old poetry books. In ‘Go to the Limits of Your Longing’, Rainer Maria Rilke writes:

> You, sent out beyond your recall, go to the limits of your longing. Embody me. Flare up like a flame and make big shadows I can move in. Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror. Just keep going. No feeling is final. Don’t let yourself lose me. Nearby is the country they call life. You will know it by its seriousness. Give me your hand.

Today was a hard day, but soon it will be over. The birds are singing their goodnights outside my window, the sky is dusky blue and quieting pink, and nearby is the country they call life. The sun rises again tomorrow! I am reaching out!

**Thursday (Day 43).** Worked on the same workshops from yesterday, just a little slower, and with some recaps over the harder bits. Also, had a really interesting, affirming talk from Will Peachey, and another mindset session with Joe about using the GROW model to confront difficulties on your journey. A tiring day, and not much new to report, since it was more about developing on what we've already covered, but just need to get better at. Did a lot of work in class and a lot of hours after, though, working on the code and getting different bits and bobs to work or become clearer. Some days are sprints, some days are marathons!

**Friday (Day 44).** Hackathon Friday!

This week, our job was to build a RESTful API server using node.js, express, postgres and a load of other big and little technologies. And we did really well! We got stuck right at the end trying to fix our routers up, but our plan and documentation was really solid, and we largely made good, consistent progress. We coded with good readability, and when we did hit errors, we tested to narrow down exactly what part of our routers were being problematic, so I'm still proud of what we managed on a difficult week. With a bit more time, I think we'd have gotten it down.

Also had a great mentor meeting! My mentor's on a holiday-and-hackathon trip right now, which sounds very cool and very fun, and is a concept I'm absolutely going to steal so that I can work on bullying my friend group into doing one too. When I've eventually got time to be going on a holiday-hackathon (Holithon? Hackiday?), that is, and also I guess when any of them learn how to code. Small setback. But yeah! Had a really helpful talk too about how sexism and ableism manifest in the industry, some of the kinds of things you can do to advocate for yourself, and other bits and bobs that I wanted to get his opinion on.

**Saturday (Day 45).** Got up early and worked on the recap task for a couple of hours. We had to start from scratch and build the exact same thing as yesterday, which felt a little daunting, but it went well, and! Excitingly! I figured out my router problem from yesterday! I wasn't quite getting my async/await pairs on the routers themselves right, and fixing those fixed the problem we had been having of our payload showing up in the console but not on the webpage. Took a break after I figured that out to do some gardening and life admin, but going to carry on doing some programming for fun later!

**Sunday (Day 46).** Family dinner at dad's today, so not too much to report back on. Took my fix for the routers from the recap task, and implemented it on the routers from the hackathon, and everything looks much happier and less shouty in the console. Did a little bit of work on my website – had a study swap session with a friend yesterday, where they gave me feedback on some code and I gave them feedback on their dissertation, so was keeping that in mind – but otherwise, a chill day!

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** I think what consistently struck me this week is how fun I'm finding programming, and the trial and error process. We learned a lot of new technical things this week that I'm excited to move forward with, too. Though, it's the conversations that I've had with people that have been especially stand-out for me. My pair programmer had a really pragmatic attitude toward building and the learning process, which was really grounding to work alongside. I especially appreciated my mentor meetings this week too. They're always great, but it really hit home this week the kind of difference that attitude and perspective can make. My mentor's sense of calmness, malleability, self-advocacy and enthusiasm are always re-energising, but were particularly helpful at this juncture, and I'm going to try and mindfully, consciously centre a similar energy more myself.

# Week Six

**Week summary.** This week was my sixth week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days forty-seven through fifty-three of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. Things we worked on this week included: using Jest, Supertest and Cypress to perform unit tests, automated server testing, and E2E testing on a variety of different programming projects; how to code using TDD, and when this is and isn't a useful model to follow during development; why we test, what to test, and concepts like code coverage and what a well-tested or robust project might look like.

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 47).** This week, our focus is on testing software, and different ways to approach building testing methods, principles and best practices into our work. We had an introductory talk from Nadeem Shabir at Talis today about software testing, as well as some really solid life advice. Also, we learned a little about the uses and purpose of software testing, and got some practice in with our first testing framework, Jest.

New things are always a little hard to get to grips with at first, but the workshops went pretty well! To be transparent, though, this is the first day on the course where my emotions have felt primarily rooted in anxiety. Nebulously so, and not connected to any worries about the programming as much as just tiredness catching up with me, I think. But still, the feeling's present. So! Where I'd normally do a lot of extra work after class ends and push myself to carry on going for a couple of hours, I think I need a break, so I'm going to try and take one this week. Shorter log entries than usual, then, but it is what it is. Catch you soon!

**Tuesday (Day 48).** Did some workshopping today in Jest, following TDD principles. Also, had a really great introduction to Cypress – a technology for E2E testing – from Jordan and Robert on the Cypress developer experience team! Still feeling a bit shaky, but better than yesterday. Just trying to get some code admin done and get through the week. Looking forward to getting a bit of free time to work on some side projects over the long weekend, though, and the chats I've got scheduled with my enablement coach and my mentor towards the end of the week.

**Wednesday (Day 49).** Tested with Cypress properly for the first time, and used supertest to test an API server. My meeting with my enablement coach was pushed to next week, but that can't be helped. Otherwise, though, this is the last day of the working week – it's the long bank holiday weekend for the Platinum Jubilee – and in retrospect, coding has gone really well this week! My pair programmer has been very sharp and capable, and we've been able to get some really good work done on all our workshops. We've been given a longer recap task than usual this week, to get some extra practice in considering we're missing two taught days, but it all looks pretty doable.

**Thursday (Day 50).** Worked on some workshops from the week through the day, and got some programming done for the recap task. Testing is a little dry, but necessary, and thankfully a pretty accessible facet of programming compared to some concepts which are harder to grasp or execute. I also had a meeting with my mentor at the end of the day. Even on weeks when I don't necessarily have anything technical to ask about, I always find mentor meetings to be a part of my day that really helps re-energise and re-centre me, and puts a lot of things into perspective. Keeping in mind Nadeem's advice on Monday about not going so above and beyond that you exhaust yourself, and my mentor's advice that sometimes you have to literally just do anything other than programming for a bit, and that's what I'm going to do.

**Friday (Day 51).** Didn’t do much today! I tinkered with a few configurations for the automated tests in my workshops, and also started reading some articles about React. Spent most of the day out with my mum, shopping for yarn and cooking. Feeling better rested and ready to get back to it at my usual level!

**Saturday (Day 52).** Got a lot of work in today. Finished up my testing workshops as much as I am happy with – they're not perfect, but they're functional and I'm pleased with them, which is enough – and then read into some more resources on React, and got a lot of work done on some side projects and non-SoC programming. Took a look at jQuery for the first time, but it wasn't quite working out as I wanted it to, so I'm going to come back for it for the project I was using it on another time. Tomorrow, I'm going to do a little bit more programming and my usual coding admin (sorting out this log and tidying up notes etc.) in the morning, and then I'm going to close my laptop and do other stuff!

**Sunday (Day 53).** Tinkered on my portfolio side project some more, and doing my code admin, and updating this log. Reflecting back on this week, I think having the tiredness hit me now was well-timed for a longer weekend, but also has made me a bit more conscious of some of my working flaws. In general, I push myself to get a lot of work done, and to keep up a certain pace and level of quality that is absolutely achievable in moderation, but maybe not twelve hours a day, every day. Taking a slower approach this week has given me a chance to regroup, and while I'm ready to get back to it on Monday, I think maybe I'm going to be more conscious about having extended non-programming breaks on my weekends going forward.

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** I was talking to my mentor about the difficulty of pulling yourself away from code, whether it's because you're having fun or it's not finished, and he talked about how sometimes, even if you get to the end of the day and there's a big problem you still haven't figured out, you just have to tell yourself that your workday finishes at five, turn off the computer, and go and do something else. Maybe 'take it easier' isn't the most on-brand message to commit, but if you're reading this and wondering to yourself whether you should take a day off? A couple hours of rest aren't going to end the world. You've made it this far already, and you're going to carry on being just fine, even if you pick up what you're doing on Monday instead.

<br />

# Week Seven

**Week summary.** This week was my seventh week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days fifty-four through sixty of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. Things we worked on this week included: introduction to React; converting vanilla JS into React; working with CRA, JSX and Babel; abstracting and structuring files so as to separate concerns in React and with React components; how useState and hooks more generally work and operate; working with props.

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 54).** First day of React!

Feeling a lot better than last week, and ready to get back to it. In the morning, we had a great talk and question and answer session from an ex-bootcamper, Piper, who just started their second tech job with Bamboo. It was really interesting to hear about how they approached the bootcamp and post-bootcamp spaces, and I think getting the perspective of someone who – by their own confession – struggled on the bootcamp was really useful. I really appreciated what they told us about resting enough and having fun on the bootcamp, and I hope we hear back from them again soon!

Otherwise, in the afternoon, me and my new weekly pair programmer got started on some workshops making React components and learning about React syntax and architecture. I’m excited to see the new things it can accomplish. Speeding up!

**Tuesday (Day 55).** Busy day today!

We were learning a little more about React and worked through some workshops on components, but we also got into using JSX and Babel too: we started yesterday using the most vanilla, manual version of React, and the idea is to use the bare bones and eventually add on layers of abstraction, so that we can fully understand what is happening functionally under the hood. We also started using Create React App to make a basic React application, which we’re going to be continuing tomorrow. We also got a little bit of work in understanding and using props!

We also had a great talk from a SoC mentor and engineer from BT, Nick Truby, about how he uses React in his work, and his journey from bootcamper to mid-level engineer. He had a great energy, and he’s going to be dropping in on code club tomorrow to answer questions and show us some more stuff in React with Hamza.

I also had my rescheduled enablement meeting today. It's always good to get the chance to reflect on your growth, and to see where you're heading next. Anyway, got lots to do, so I’m going to dash! Catch up later!

**Wednesday (Day 56).** Nearly midnight, exhausted! Learned a lot today about useState, hooks generally, revision on props, and compartmentalising our code into reusable components. We also had a talk from a Birmingham company called adaptable about React, and did a load of workshops. Just spent a few hours trying to figure one out. Finally got it! Very tired though, so turning in.

**Thursday (Day 57).** Really long day with a lot of difficult code. Spent most of the evening going over the day's workshops and got them working, but now I'm very tired, so will check in later!

**Friday (Day 58).** Hackathon Friday!

Mixed bag today outcome-wise, but I think technically-wise, presentation and attitude-wise, me and my pair programmer learned a lot and grew a lot. The challenge today was to build a React app from scratch, and specifically, a to-do list. We had to be able to input new items into the list array, which would be mapped onto the screen, and the entries to which should be editable and deletable. We got our file architecture and most of our functions working perfectly, and only stumbled when it got to using functions as props, and passing the outcomes of certain functions to other components so as to set state in different bits of the app.

The positive is that we knew where we were getting stuck, and what to look for resources on to figure out the answer! The unfortunate part is that we weren't able to make as much progress as we wanted in the second half of the day. I think what was a really fruitful exercise, though, was being able to reflect and present to a group of about thirty other bootcampers on the experience. When you're stuck or making slow progress against a tight deadline, it's easy to catastrophise and lose your focus, I think. It's also not the easiest thing to admit when something was hard or didn't turn out as you ideally would've liked outloud, especially in a group presentation! But me and my partner put together a concise retrospective and our presentation went really well, and I'm super proud of what we managed, and I know it'll just be a matter of practice and time before we're up to speed. No one learned React in four days flat, after all!

**Saturday (Day 59).** Been working on the recap tasks a lot of the day. Battling to get a hang of some useState stuff and passing between the component tree, but I've got further than I got yesterday, which is enough for now! Going to take some time to rest and step away from it, to let that diffuse learning set in.

**Sunday (Day 60).** Not re-addressed the hackathon yet – which I want to go back and do – but finished off the recap tasks today, and managed to get a working version of what stumped us on Friday! It's not very tidy at all, and it still needs a lot of work, but I feel like I've learned a lot over the weekend. Worn out, though, and tragically I have been stricken by a stomach bug, so going to take the rest of the day easier.

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** Technically, we've learned so much this week, though to be honest, my brain's a bit too fried to reflect on it all at once! I think a really important and productive part of the week was our presentation, though: being able to address roadblocks and difficulties, and present those and ways to move on from them to a group of people in a semi-professional context, is a skill I'm glad we got some practice in building. I think I'm still learning the lesson from last week too, that sometimes you really do just need a break and to take things slower. I told my mentor on Friday that I was going to work on my projects until they were functional and done, but that just wasn't a useful approach after a long day on Friday, and even on Saturday and Sunday. I think a combination of having some enforced breaks from code over the weekend, and being able to take things a little bit slower through independent study, have helped me get a firmer grasp on the week's material.

There was also a great workshop this week – not sure if I mentioned it in an entry – with Trenton Moss from Team Sterka, about working in teams and learning more about your communication style, and how to work with people who communicate in different ways too. I scored near the middle of the quadrant as having a director-type communication style. On first reaction, I didn't really feel like it was accurate, and then hilariously had my opinion proved wrong consistently through the rest of the week when my need to work slower to absorb the material began to frustrate me. Which! I think will be something I'll need to keep in mind as we carry on through this journey. Your weaknesses and your strengths are the exact same characteristics: it's how they manifest and how you learn to use and manage them that makes the difference in the moment.

# Week Eight

**Week summary.** This week was my eigth week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days sixty-one through sixty-seven of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. Things we worked on this week included: more work with React and state through useReducer and learning about finite state machines; learning about useEffect and how (and how not to) use it; using React Testing Library; teamwork and communication mindset; Git branching; research task on Agile and Scrum; practice building and rebuilding an app with increasing layers of abstraction; hackathon where we put every part of project planning and management into place.

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 61).** More React this week! We went over the beta docs to learn a little about the idea of pure and impure functions, and then we learned about useEffect, and hilariously, how we really should avoid using it at all costs. Low energy in the bootcamp today, but hopefully a second week to practice React will make things sink in a bit easier. Plus side is useEffect came a bit easier than last week’s code, and I think I’m slowly getting the hang of what’s going on. Chris also returned on short notice to tutor us today, since Liz was sick! So that was fun.

**Tuesday (Day 62).** We were focusing on useReducer today, which we covered theoretically by looking into finite state machines, before moving onto using them practically inside of React. Getting state to work is still kind of hard to handle, but with a lot of help from coaches and other bootcampers, we got there in the end! Going to do some extra work on it tonight, and then I've got a friend's dissertation I promised I'd start proofing. Eyes are very tired!

**Wednesday (Day 63).** Today we learned how to use React Testing Library to test in React, with more of a focus on unit tests, and we revised some of the main tenets of testing in general as well as going through a good couple of testing workshops and exercises. We also had a really great company talk from Mark and Haley at Experian. Their company culture and the learning environment sounds really nurturing and like it would be a great place to grow, and I hope we hear more from them or see them again in the future.

**Thursday (Day 64).** Today we had a mindset session with Joe about team dynamics in preparation for project week next week. We also learned a little bit about how git branching and pull requests work, and we got some practice in with a workshop. We also had a great talk from Nadeem and Camille at Talis about how to design and architect APIs – always enjoy hearing from the team at Talis, everyone's got a really refreshing outlook and energy - and then we did a research task in the afternoon around Agile.

I was in a team with my pair programmer for the week and the pair who 'live next door' (in the Zoom room one number up), and our focus was on giving a miniature presentation about Scrum as a framework! Usually we present at four o'clock in breakout rooms to about thirty other bootcampers. This week, though, we were asked to record our presentation and upload it, so that other bootcampers could use it as a resource to come back to later in their own time. It was a little nerve-wracking recording ourselves, I think! Even though it's the same as presenting, really, there's something about having a recording in perpetuity that just feels a little bit more eek! At least considering it's only the second time we've had to record ourselves for anything for SoC. The recording went very well, though, and watching it back, I think our presentation was really clean and kept perfectly to time. I was really proud of the team and the work we got done in such a short amount of time, and the exercise really gave me a confidence and energy boost.

In the evening, I spent a good chunk of time re-building last week's hackathon over and over, adding layers of complexity each time to try and get a better understanding of how different bits of React work, while also tuning into the CodeLand 2022 conference. It's a conference geared toward inclusivity in tech and early-career programmers and students, and there was a lot of really great learning material there.

**Friday (Day 65).** Hackathon Friday! The brief this week was to make a React app from scratch that interacted with an API in some way. We could choose the API and make whatever design choices we wanted, but the brief emphasised following the design processes and project flows we've been using and learning about, and making sure to keep good documentation of the work we did and why we did it.

For our project, we decided to make a QR code app, which takes in user input as a variable and returns a QR code generated by an API associated with whatever variable the user inputted. It was important to us to get an MVP up and running before anything else, so after we'd done our ideas jamboard, wireframes, and written up some plans and stretch goals, we made sure we had the base-level of the project coded by the end of the morning, before reviewing our progress and deciding on a more specific direction then. We didn't get all our stretch goals completed, but we got some good practice in at organising a project and rethinking our direction in response to roadblocks or new factors. I enjoyed the day, and it was nice to get some practice in at a small version of what we're going to be doing next week.

I had a meeting with my enablement coach in the afternoon, which was really helpful: it's nice to be able to check-in on your progress with someone outside of yourself, and to get a barometer on how you're doing and where you've come from. I also had my usual weekly mentor meeting after class, which was great as always. My mentor's swapping teams at his workplace next week to something that sounds very impressive and agonisingly complicated to work on. It's going to be really cool to hear about it over the next couple of weeks! Really exciting stuff!

**Saturday (Day 66).** Got started on the recap task for the weekend, which was to do some self-directed revision and learning before project week begins. Honestly, I'm a bit apprehensive about project week – I think nerves are normal! But I will say that one nice thing is, on reflection, I don't think there's anything we've covered on the course that I'd be utterly unable to get to grips with if it was needed in a fullstack project. I spent some time going over my notes and workshop code for the past two weeks of React, and carried on working on the toDoList W7 Hackathon redo that I've been working on. Also had a breakthrough on what exactly useState is trying to achieve, so that was great. Hoping similar epiphanies continue to cement.

**Sunday (Day 67).** Carried on working on the toDoList project and got all my technical MVP goals accomplished! Feel like I've really deepened my understanding, even if I'm not totally all the way there. Got a couple of things on in the afternoon, so wanted to at least make sure this diary was written up, and then I'm just going to do what I can before my other appointments kick in. And then, I'm going to relax! Anticipating a busy week next week!

**Takeaways.** Sometimes, it really does take time, practice, and doing things easy before you do them 'normal' or hard to grow your understanding of a topic. And that's fine! One thing my pair programmer this week was great at was reaching out to ask for help too, which I think is definitely a growth area for me, so that was a good learning opportunity. Another thing that was an important feature of this week for me outside of just coding was building community, especially with other people in tech spaces from non-traditional backgrounds. Having those kinds of connections with other people can really make a difference, and even though it can be a little daunting reaching out sometimes, I'm really energised to continue developing in that area.

# Week Nine

**Week summary.** This week was my ninth week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days sixty-eight through seventy-four of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. This week was the mid-course project week! We teamed up in groups of four and five to build MVPs of full-stack applications, which we then demoed live for industry professionals on Friday for some feedback. It was a great chance to put everything that we've learnt so far into practice, and I had a lot of fun developing software with [Nafiso](https://github.com/nafisoaden97), [Ismail](https://github.com/Ismailali99) and [Sam](https://github.com/samsonhumber)!

<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 68).** First day of project week!

We started the day bright and early by getting our brief off of Chris – to create an MVP of a full-stack application, that could help improve the lives of bootcampers – and got started right away. Our team decided not to code on day one, but to devote the day to ideation and design. We spent some time drawing up a team manifesto on how we'd prioritise work, make decisions and settle disagreements – just in case – and talking through how we wanted to structure our working day and week as a whole. We then spent some time coming up with ideas for what we wanted to build, and drawing up user personas, journeys and maps to try and refine down our concept.

In the end, the idea we voted on was to build a yearbook app, which would hold current and ex-bootcamper contact and biography information, whether they were open to things like mentoring, networking, and team projects, and should be filterable to find people from the bootcamp who shared similar interests to you.

After we agreed on that idea, we got working on low and high-fidelity wireframes and spent the rest of the afternoon focusing on UI and design. Our team put together some colour swatches which I tested and edited for accessibility, and our final wireframe can be seen on this [Figma live preview](https://www.figma.com/proto/x24VtV2v5KdFi7KAXZhvsH/room21-design?node-id=34%3A67&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=34%3A67). I also started up a Notion page for our documentation and records.

**Tuesday (Day 69).** For Tuesday, we decided the goal for EOD was to have built the static MVP for the front and back-end of our project.

The team put together a Trello to keep track of our todos and tickets, and we finalised a component tree and data flow diagram that Sam really helpfully had put together for us as a first draft. It really helped to have those structural guides in place, so that we could make sure we were aligned on our technical directions while branching off and doing different things. After we'd made sure we were all on the same page, we got going!

Me and Nafiso worked on the front-end React app, putting together our components, shell fetch requests and CSS and front-end test files, and Ismail and Sam worked on putting together a Heroku postgreSQL database and building an Express server and API. We built some static data arrays in the front-end to work with and test our components on while Ismail and Sam were putting together the back-end. Me and Nafiso pair programmed the main `Biography` component together, as that was the core function of the front-end and we wanted to make sure that it had had two pairs of eyes on it to make it the best we could. After that, we created our own separate branches, and put together our other components, reviewing PRs and merging as we went.

By the time the whole team came back together at the end of the day, we'd gotten all of our goals for the day completed, and were ready to add dynamism to the build on Wednesday!

**Wednesday (Day 70).** Wednesday was all about linking everything together. We switched up the teams so everyone got the chance to work on different things, and so while Nafiso and Ismail tackled some of the remaining work and fixes needed on the back-end, me and Sam got the front hooked up to our API. There were a couple of clunky bits, but there was something so exciting about seeing the first successful .json come through from our fetch request to the back-end in a console.log. We've built APIs and front-ends and small apps before, but it was just really special to see this project that we'd designed as a team start working as a dynamic whole. Two months ago, we didn't even know what APIs were! It was a really great moment.

After that, we had a team meeting to decide what move we wanted to make next. We'd put a hard stop on coding time at Thursday midday: we wanted a good couple of hours to clean up and create our presentation for Friday afternoon, which left us with limited time to carry on working on the actual core code. We debated for a while about whether we should use the remaining couple of hours to implement React Router and add some shells for additional pages that were in the stretch goals of our MVP plan, or whether we wanted to really clean up what we'd done, and focus on testing.

In the end, we decided to pursue more rigorous testing. We put some unit and integration tests in place on the front and back, checking our core components and functionality – the shape of the data we were sending and receiving, and how our `Biography` component was mapping onto the page – and we also ran a Lighthouse report to check for any accessibility issues with our app. We started with a pretty high score, but after a couple of edits by Nafiso and Ismail, we managed to get our accessibility score up to 100, which was great.

**Thursday (Day 71).** Final touches! I had a finicky bug I wanted to fix on a front-end component, and there were a few finishing touches the team wanted to put on different things, so we all took two hours on a group call to tidy up the last big bits and pieces. And then, we went through the front and back-end code as a team. This is so we could review how it all worked and to make sure we were happy with our knowledge of the app for the presentation and Q&A session on Friday, but also so that we could check for any typos, syntax errors, and make some final team decisions on last unfinished small bits.

Then, once we were all happy with how the code was looking, we took a break for dinner, and worked on our presentation in the afternoon! The week went by so fast, but when we sat down to put the presentation together reflecting on what we'd done, it really was so much work. Some things we'd even forgotten about having done. Thursday was really a great chance to review how far we'd come, and to practice presenting ourselves and our work to others, and curating the most important parts of the journey that we wanted to communicate. We got most of the work done and got one or two practice runs through the presentation in, and then called it a day.

**Friday (Day 72).** Presentation day!

Very nervous, but very, very excited! We had the morning to get a bit of practice in, had a break at dinner, and then we were introduced to the guest judges afterwards, who were senior developers and engineers from a variety of our industry partners. A few familiar faces and many not, but all really gracious to have donated their time to come and give us some valuable feedback.

And then it was time! We had about an hour before our slot, so the team chatted and tried to relax a little in our Zoom room to distract from the nerves. But then, it was presentation time, and as soon as it had begun, it was over! The judges asked us a few questions and gave us some feedback, and we'll be getting more in-depth feedback over the next few weeks, passed on through the coches. Overall, though, really enjoyed the experience! Thanks especially to our coach Hamza for MC'ing us and settling some of our nerves before and after the presentation itself, as well as to Ruth from TravelPerk, and Jordan and Ryan from Experian for their time!

We debriefed as a team afterwards and then took a break, before coming back together for the closing comments, and some feedback from Chris too. Then, we finished the day early. There was an optional bootcamper social on, but honestly, I needed the rest more. So! I took a quick lie down, got back up for my usual mentor meeting – great and useful as always, and also just a tiny, little bit funny to hear that my mentor was having a similarly manic week in his new role, just much higher up the programming foodchain – then! Well-deserved Sims and pizza were the evening's plans!

**Saturday (Day 73).** Didn't do anything too heavy! Got started on some design work for remaking my portfolio in React, and started putting together a React Router for the site. Taking it easy after a long week, though. Listened back one of our older mindset lectures and had a cheeky bubble bath.

**Sunday (Day 74).** Did a bit of reading of a few resources my mentor sent me, eyeballed the portfolio code again, and typed up this! Again, still trying to relax before Monday kicks off again, so nothing major honestly.

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** Honestly, I'm still a bit frazzled from the whole week! I don't know if I can fully verbalise everything I learned this week, or even if it's all sunk in yet. I think there's just a really big value to having been able to practice all the things we've been learning as a four-person team, and to see how all those different moving parts come together. It's been a really great illuminator of some of my weaknesses, but also of my strengths, and I can't wait to build more things with more people, and to carry on growing and improving.

It was also quite funny to me that my unnecessarily strong devotion to note-taking and file organising came in very handy this week – can never have too much accessible, clear documentation for your projects! As silly as it sounds, I'm very excited to put some new project management and documentation practices into action on the next project.

I think a big thread through the week for me has been one of gratefulness, too. I think about something Kyle said to us on and off a lot, that all programming problems are people problems, and people are at the heart of everything we're trying to do. Hugely greatful for everyone at SoC who helped me get to this point, to my team for what we managed to get done this week, and to our coaches, my mentor, and everyone along the way helping us out on the journey.

# Week Ten

**Week summary.** This week was my tenth week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days seventy-five through eighty-one of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. This week, our focus was on looking retrospectively over how project week went, what could be improved, and how we could move forward with the projects, as well as what we all learned and took away from the experience. We also added increased testing and some documentation to the projects. The second part of the week was focused on learning more about auth0 and how to build in user authentication and authorisation on the front and back-end.

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 75).** Back in the dream team! Today, we got back into our project week teams and got started on bigger retrospectives of the week. Then, we spent some time doing code reviews of our own code and of another team's, before meeting back up at the end of the day to give each other group feedback on how the reviews had gone and to ask questions.

It was really useful to be able to look back, both at our project, and at another project in whole. I found it was an exercise that was very helpful in solidifying why you might make certain technical or project management choices over others, and in finding out what choices make your projects and code more accessible to others.

**Tuesday (Day 76).** A bit of a long day, so not much to write right now, as it's currently late!

Got in some Codewars – must've woken up on the right side of the bed, because I managed to get through three very quickly and without errors, which made ranking up very exciting – and then we started learning a bit more about documentation. Then, we spent most of the day writing tests and docs for our project week app.

**Wednesday (Day 77).** Did some more docs work today, cleaning them up – my former (and still current) life as a proofreader coming in useful – and got some more Cypress and Jest testing set-up on our front-end. Also, edited some of our existing unit tests to be a little more semantic and useful, and highlighted a few weaknesses in the code through doing our tests that should be addressed later on. Then, we met up with the same team as we spoke to on Monday, to compare code and edits over the past few days, to see what we could change, and what we’d all learned.

It was honestly a really useful exercise, and it was nice to get a bit more practice in working on the testing side of things. Sam and Ismail also managed to find out how to abstract hooks into their own folder, so that’s cool! Not eyeballed it yet to see how it works, but going to have a proper look later on.

**Thursday (Day 78).** Last mindset with Joe today! Also, we had a talk from Code Creative, whose video got me to follow SoC and eventually apply and get in, so it was super cool to hear from him about his career, and how to advance from non-professional to professional programming. Then, we met our week ten partners - who is someone I've wanted to work with for ages, and tragically we only get to work together for two days, but such is life! - and we got started on what we’re doing this week, which is learning how to use authenticators and authorisation code.

A bit tricky, to be honest! Got it working, and understand generally why, but I'm going to need to read the docs and experiment more to understand exactly what's going on in the details. Excited to carry on working with it during tomorrow's auth-a-thon.

**Friday (Day 79).** Get it a little more today! We got all the bits moving with auth0 on front and back, and then we even managed to connect them, which took us a while but was very, very exciting when it all came together.

I also had an enablement coach meeting today, where we talked about things to start working on to get ready for the end of the course. One of the partnerships team dropped in too, to tell me about a really cool event that SoC is putting together in August, which I'll hopefully be able to attend!

As usual, also had my mentor meeting after everything wrapped up on Friday, and got some really helpful insight into hiring and interview processes and how projects are managed and made on the day-to-day.

**Saturday (Day 80).** Recap task this week is more focused on self-directed learning, addressing things we've been learning about during this week. So, I decided to focus on cleaning up my portfolio and GitHub by adding documentation to projects, and maybe trying to get another project or two into a decent state. Getting more proper practice in with React Router.

**Sunday (Day 81).** More of the same as yesterday!

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** Having the chance this week to look back on the project was really useful, and getting the chance to work on something for more than one week let us dig in a little further than usual in a productive way. The weeks seem to be going so fast now – only two more weeks of learning time, and then it's the final project – I almost can't believe it. I was talking to my enablement coach about it earlier this week, and while it's a little intimidating to be two-thirds of the way through, I'm so excited to carry on going and learn more and more, and to be able to do more things. Like finally getting out of the tutorial zone in a video game: there are bigger, scarier monsters, but there's also so much more to find, and so many more things you can do and become.

<br />

# Week Eleven

**Week summary.** This week was my eleventh week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days eighty-two through eighty-seven of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. This week, our focus was on learning more about deployment, and getting ready to start working on the recruitment, job-hunting and post-graduation sector of the course.

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 82).** This week's focus is going to be mostly on deployment, I think. As such, today we learned about deploying front-ends, and started practicing that by deploying a SPA onto Netlify. It went pretty seamlessly! Got a couple of hours in fixing some bugs on some side projects. Have a nightmare CSS problem on my portfolio, but I think I know how to fix it, so I'll have a go tomorrow.

**Tuesday (Day 83).** Got a load of work done deploying the front and back-ends of an app today, on Netlify and Heroku respectively. Was kind of fiddly, but got it all working. Also figured out yesterday’s CSS bug, though made a new one in the process, but it is what it is. Very tired and feeling ill, so going to tap out of this diary early and rest.

**Wednesday (Day 84).** Shifted gears a bit today. In the morning, we did a research task into context in React. Our workshop was to turn what we learned into a tutorial, so me and my pair programmer wrote an article.

In the afternoon, we learned about how to use custom hooks in React - which was quite useful, as I’d asked my mentor about it before and tried to figure it out on my own, but hadn’t got too far yet on it. Managed to get all the base tasks of the workshop working, and read the docs on local storage for one of them, so being exposed to new concepts.

After class, put in a couple hours cleaning up some code and adding in some more structure on side projects.

**Thursday (Day 85).** Today, we practiced creating our ten second introductions with our partners. Then, Couchbase came in to do a half-day demo on their product and how to use it, and we did a competition and had to try and finish their code in a certain time frame.

I got most of the code working before class ended, but was missing a few small key details. Worked on it and banged my head against the docs a bit after class wrapped, but sometimes it's one of those days. Maybe next time!

**Friday (Day 86).** AWS Hackathon today, where our challenge was to deploy a full-stack app with AWS Amplify and then get through a few extra bonus steps. Me and my partner had a very chaotic experience of this hackathon due to technical failures on both our ends, but I think we learned a lot from just having to troubleshoot and fix problems, even if we didn't build all that much comparatively. We had some really useful discussions with other teams at the end of the day about how everyone had experienced the day. Then, I had my mentor meeting after we wrapped, where it was nice to get some insight into alternative technologies to the ones we'd been using this week.

**Saturday.** No code today, attended a family wedding!

**Sunday (Day 87).** Writing up this log, going to do some side project work and read a through articles and resources.

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** I haven't enjoyed deployment as much as other aspects of programming we've been learning over the past few weeks, but it's important to at least know a bit about where you're situated in a space, even if you don't have a great passion about it. It's been a week of small, steady and incremental progress - inside and outside of the things we've been learning on the bootcamp - which has been a productive experience. It was also interesting to look back on where we started, so that we can look forward towards what life might be like in a few months post-course. I can't believe that next week is our last week of taught learning before the final project. It feels like we've been at SoC for so long, though simultaneously, time has flown. Very excited for what's next! And also a little bittersweet that there's not so long left now.

<br />

# Week Twelve

**Week summary.** This week was my twelfth week at the School of Code bootcamp, and I also completed days eighty-six through ninety-four of the _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge. This week, things we learned and worked with included: component libraries and frameworks, including Chakra UI; a one-person hackathon to build or improve our portfolios; learning a little more about the technicalities of JavaScript as a language; learning about TypeScript, and getting to use it in a couple of different workshops and a hackathon project.

<details>
<summary>Monday – Sunday</summary>
<br />

**Monday (Day 86).** Last Monday before project month today!

We swapped partners today, before having a great talk from an ex-bootcamper - Valerio Cipolla - about how to approach the final weeks, relaxing and keeping yourself healthy (physically and mentally), and what happens immediately after the bootcamp. It was really useful to hear his feedback, especially as someone who also - from the sounds of it - worked a bit too hard. Going to try and take some of his reflections on board before next week.

After that, we got some reading in on component libraries and frameworks, and then me and my partner experimented with Chakra UI by building a small SPA. Then, we split into groups to talk about the different libraries we’d all used, and to compare how they feel and work.

Got a splitting headache and it’s very, very hot in the UK today, so I’m not my best writing self. Valerio’s advice was especially useful though, and I wrote everything he said down, so I’m going to reflect on that later.

Also, wrote my first comment on a LinkedIn post today, so we’re making progress getting more comfortable with networking!

**Tuesday (Day 89).** Today, we had a talk from Dan Newns at Jump24 about agency culture in tech and how he’s been trying to change it within his company. Then, we were given all the rest of the day to ourselves for a mini self-hackathon, where we could work on our portfolio websites.

Which was super useful! I’ve been working on mine a lot on the side, so it was nice to get the chance to iron out some bugs. It’s not perfect, but I got some nice visuals added to it and it was nice to have some time to look over it. One of my friends on the bootcamp also showed me her lava lamp CSS background that she'd built, which was honestly so cool, and we gathered in small groups to talk about our progress at the end of the day.

Also, had a go rebuilding my site in Next.js to see if I could sort out some router problems I was having. It’s not complete yet, but Next.js seems pretty intuitive, so going to have another crack later.

**Wednesday (Day 90).** Today, we did some Codewars and learned a little bit more about some weird quirks of JavaScript, such as how its operators and operands work and are read, associativity, dynamic and static and weak and strongly typed languages, and so on. We used this new knowledge as a basis to get started on Typescript, which we’re going to be working on for the next few days!

It was kind of fun to look into working with JavaScript in a new way, that maybe is more linguistically similar to other languages. I’ve been thinking about branching out into another language after the course, and it’s been fun to experiment with more theoretical aspects and knowledge.

Tomorrow, we’re continuing our basic Typescript workshop, before doing some work on Typescript in React.

**Thursday (Day 91).** Today, we did some Codewars.

Then, Chris came in to talk to us all about getting employment ready, and using LinkedIn and other softwares and services to prep for roles.

Then, we did some practice technical interviews! I was pretty nervous about this, as I tend to need (or feel like I need) more time on the mathier kind of problems you see on platforms like Codewars. No sense in being scared of things indefinitely, though, so I volunteered to go first, to confront my nerves. In the end, I got pretty close to finishing the code, and my feedback was that I was good at communicating my thoughts and intentions while coding, and my planning and logic were sound, which if nothing else, did help alleviate some of my crash-and-burn catastrophising about technical interviews.

After that, we worked with TypeScript in React for the rest of the day. Thinking about how close we are to the end of our learning time on at School of Code - only tomorrow left, really - and how much there is to reflect on. Honestly, though, I'm a bit too tired to reflect! So maybe later in the week.

**Friday (Day 92).** Last Hackathon Friday at the School of Code!

Today, we built a weather app using TypeScript in React, using a weather API we were linked to by the coaches. There were two ways you could use the API: it could take in either city name parameters and would perform its own geolocating in order to return a weather forecast, but the forecast was not very detailed, and the automatic geo-locator was going to be deprecated eventually, so the code would need restructuring. Alternatively, the same API provider also had a separate geolocating API that you could then pass more specific information to the weather API from. It was a bit more complicated, structurally and state-wise, to do that, but it’s what our team decided to do to create additional longevity in the code.

And it was a bit tricky at times! But we got our MVP finished and were really proud of the detail. My team this week was a lot of fun, and I feel like I learned a lot: a great final pair programming team before Project Month.

Also had an enablement coach meeting today, which really did provide a great chance to look back on the course and reflect on what I’ve learned, and in particular what strengths I’ve uncovered or developed that can be carried forward into our teams on Monday. I’ve really appreciated the enablement coach meetings for how they let us get feedback on the learning journey and consider our growth and potential holistically.

And, as usual for Fridays, had my mentor meeting at the end of the day. I’ve been a bit apprehensive about Project Month - as I suppose anyone would be! - but I got some really useful advice on how to conceptualise success in a project like this, at this stage in our journeys, as well as just general perspective in this week’s meeting. It is about doing, creating and building, but it’s also about having fun! Also picked up some really cool tips on how to start building robots, had some general tech chatter, and got to hear about how my mentor’s new job and side projects are going, which was really cool to hear about.

But yeah! No recap task this week, except to look over things generally and revise, to rest, and to reflect, so I’m going to try and take it a little easier before things get manic from next week.

**Saturday (Day 93).** Took most of today to relax, help my sister do some DIY in the garden, play video games, start building one of my family member's birthday presents, and otherwise be away from my laptop for the first time in a while! Put an hour in on Codewars in the evening, though, and read through a few technical articles.

**Sunday (Day 94).** Last day before Project Month! Eek!

Not sure what I'm going to get done today, but I think I'm going to work some more on the hackathon we did on Friday, to make the CSS a little bit less hideous, and then maybe just start up a few projects for fun that I can work on for the next few weekends. My mentor gave me a great tip this week, since we share in common that we are prone to overworking, that something that works for him is making sure he has non-work programming projects to work on in his free time. Then, he can still programme - which is a fun thing to do! - while also making sure he's not just working all hours of the week. I really want to make one of those CYOA command line games or something, so I think that might be what I start planning! Or something else! Who knows!

Also, just went through the final mindset module from Joseph (Trodden) about identifying your personal core values, and the ways in which these can be a strength or a weakness, and how they interact with others on a team. My current values, in order, come out as: integrity, adventure, compassion, determination, and creativity. It was a really interesting exercise to find these out and narrow them down, which helped illuminate some of the drivers behind some of my choices and behaviours. I've really enjoyed and appreciated Joe's mindset sessions through the course, and we've learned a lot from them.

</details>

<br />

**Takeaways.** Really enjoyed getting to use TypeScript this week! Don't think I've mentioned that anywhere in the rest of my learning log for W12, but it's actually been a lot of fun experimenting with a superset of JavaScript that has a few different language features that you have to work with and around. I'm quite excited to start learning another language once the course ends, and this introduction really helped bolster that feeling.

Also, as an aside, not sure what format my learning diary is going to take from Monday onwards, but I'm going to try and keep one. If I don't update this weekly for a while going forward, though, I'll update the top of the document, or otherwise update this at the end of the course in one chunk.

If anyone ever does read this far! Thank you so much for your time! And if by chance any future or potential bootcamper is reading this, I hope at least some of my reflections and experiences - or even just some details of the course timeline and workload - have been useful to you!

# Weeks Thirteen – Seventeen - Upcoming!

**Week(s) summary.** Final group project segment!
